Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models."}

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average."}

Characterizing How Meaningful Information is Distributed Across Multiple Channels", "comment": null, "summary": "Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages."}

In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences.

Code and artifacts will be uploaded to https://github.com/hank0316/AdaSearch", "summary": "Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors."}

While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed."}

Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks."}

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models.

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings."}

We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions.

Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies.

In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation."}

In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity.

It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling.

Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training.

This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework.

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images.

Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors.

Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation."}

Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.

Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed."}

Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process.

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75).

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average."}

Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems.

In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation.

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks."}

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings."}

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation."}

We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors.

Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types.
