The framework is built on a hybrid Bayesian inference scheme that represents the joint multi-source probability density and incorporates physics-informed state transitions, including source birth, removal, and merging induced by atmospheric dispersion. A superposition-based measurement model is naturally accommodated, allowing sparse concentration measurements to be exploited efficiently. To guide robot deployment, we introduce a wind-aware coverage control (WCC) strategy that integrates the evolving multi-source belief with local wind information to prioritize regions of high detection likelihood. Unlike conventional coverage control or information-theoretic planners, WCC explicitly accounts for anisotropic plume transport when modelling sensor performance, leading to more effective sensor placement for multi-source estimation. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate faster convergence and improved separation of individual source beliefs compared to traditional coverage-based strategies and small-scale static sensor networks. Real-world experiments with CO2 releases using TurtleBot platforms further validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its practicality for scalable multi-robot gas-sensing applications."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable robots to generate symbolic plans from natural language, yet executing these plans in simulation often requires robot-specific engineering or planner-dependent integration. In this work, we present a unified pipeline that connects an LLM-based symbolic planner with the Kautham motion planning framework to achieve generalizable, robot-agnostic symbolic-to-geometric manipulation. Kautham provides ROS-compatible support for a wide range of industrial manipulators and offers geometric, kinodynamic, physics-driven, and constraint-based motion planning under a single interface. Our system converts language instructions into symbolic actions and computes and executes collision-free trajectories using any of Kautham's planners without additional coding. The result is a flexible and scalable tool for language-driven TAMP that is generalized across robots, planning modalities, and manipulation tasks."}

Companion robots offer a potential solution. However, current companion robots often lack advanced functionality, while task-oriented robots are not designed for social interaction, limiting their suitability and acceptance by seniors. Our work introduces a senior-oriented system for quadruped robots that allows for more intuitive user input and provides more socially expressive output. For user input, we implemented a MediaPipe-based module for hand gesture and head movement recognition, enabling control without a remote. For output, we designed and trained robotic dog gestures using curriculum-based reinforcement learning in Isaac Gym, progressing from simple standing to three-legged balancing and leg extensions, and more. The final tests achieved over 95\\% success on average in simulation, and we validated a key social gesture (the paw-lift) on a Unitree robot. Real-world tests demonstrated the feasibility and social expressiveness of this framework, while also revealing sim-to-real challenges in joint compliance, load distribution, and balance control. These contributions advance the development of practical quadruped robots as social companions for the senior and outline pathways for sim-to-real adaptation and inform future user studies."}

Accepted at ACRA 2025 (Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation)", "summary": "Interactive reinforcement learning (IRL) has shown promise in enabling autonomous agents and robots to learn complex behaviours from human teachers, yet the dynamics of teacher selection remain poorly understood. This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications."}

Classical Control Barrier Function (CBF) filters assume global availability of the safety function - its value and gradient must be known everywhere - an assumption incompatible with sensing-limited settings, and the resulting filters often exhibit nonsmooth switching when constraints activate. We propose two complementary perception-aware safety filters applicable to general control-invariant safety sets. The first introduces a smooth perception gate that modulates barrier constraints based on sensing range, yielding a closed-form Lipschitz-safe controller with forward-invariance guarantees. The second replaces the hard CBF constraint with a differentiable penalty term, leading to a smooth unconstrained optimization-based safety filter consistent with CBF principles. For both designs, we establish existence, uniqueness, and forward invariance of the closed-loop trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed smooth filters enable the synthesis of higher-order tracking controllers for systems such as drones and second-order ground robots, offering substantially smoother and more robust safety-critical behaviors than classical CBF-based filters."}

Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction."}

By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality.

This system addresses the challenge of creating natural, expressive non-verbal communication for robots by integrating advanced gesture generation techniques with robust physical control. Our core innovation lies in the meticulous integration of a semantics-aware gesture synthesis module, which derives expressive reference motions from speech input by leveraging a generative retrieval mechanism based on large language models (LLMs) and an autoregressive Motion-GPT model. This is coupled with a high-fidelity imitation learning control policy, the MotionTracker, which enables the Unitree G1 humanoid robot to execute these complex motions dynamically and maintain balance. To ensure feasibility, we employ a robust General Motion Retargeting (GMR) method to bridge the embodiment gap between human motion data and the robot platform. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our combined system produces semantically appropriate and rhythmically coherent gestures that are accurately tracked and executed by the physical robot.

Kim"], "title": "Cooperative Energy Scheduling of Multi-Microgrids Based on Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy, multi-microgrids play an increasingly important role in improving the flexibility and reliability of energy supply. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance."}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs."}

EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset.

In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load.

These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems."}

Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies. Our results advance the understanding of kernel-based and measurement-based QiML methods, offering practical guidance on their applicability under varying data characteristics and computational constraints."}

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm."}

We present SPECTRA, a watermarking approach that makes training data reliably detectable even when it comprises less than 0.001% of the training corpus. SPECTRA works by paraphrasing text using an LLM and assigning a score based on how likely each paraphrase is, according to a separate scoring model. A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts. To test whether a suspect model has been trained on the watermarked data, we compare its token probabilities against those of the scoring model. We demonstrate that SPECTRA achieves a consistent p-value gap of over nine orders of magnitude when detecting data used for training versus data not used for training, which is greater than all baselines tested. SPECTRA equips data owners with a scalable, deploy-before-release watermark that survives even large-scale LLM training."}

This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions."}

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures mitigate some of these conflicts, their routing mechanisms typically rely on explicitly trained auxiliary classifiers. This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.\n  Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \\textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \\textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \\textbf{99.47\\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \\textbf{47.76\\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \\textbf{0.57\\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).\n  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \\textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks."}

This study investigates the efficacy of commonly used communication modalities by service robots, namely, acoustic/speech, visual display, and micromotion gestures in capturing attention and communicating intention with a user in a simulated restaurant scenario. We conducted a two-part user study (N=24) using a Temi robot to simulate delivery tasks, with participants engaged in a typing game (MonkeyType) to emulate a state of busyness. The participants' engagement in the typing game is measured by words per minute (WPM) and typing accuracy. In Part 1, we compared non-verbal acoustic cue versus baseline conditions to assess attention capture during a single-cup delivery task. In Part 2, we evaluated the effectiveness of speech, visual display, micromotion and their multimodal combination in conveying specific intentions (correct cup selection) during a two-cup delivery task. The results indicate that, while speech is highly effective in capturing attention, it is less successful in clearly communicating intention. Participants rated visual as the most effective modality for intention clarity, followed by speech, with micromotion being the lowest ranked.These findings provide insights into optimizing communication strategies for service robots, highlighting the distinct roles of attention capture and intention communication in enhancing user experience in dynamic hospitality settings."}

Our model is architecture-agnostic to users load, handles both clustering and power allocation without channel estimation overhead, and eliminates pilot contamination by assigning users to AP within a pilot reuse constraint. We also incorporate a customized linear attention mechanism to capture user-AP interactions efficiently and enable linear scalability with respect to the number of users. Numerical results confirm the model's effectiveness in maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency and providing near-optimal performance while ensuring adaptability and scalability in dynamic scenarios."}

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection."}

In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations."}

This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations."}

Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups."}

A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data.

The controller architecture aims to measure the interlayer temperature by a laterally positioned thermal camera and maintain a preset reference temperature by switching between the heating mode through dynamic laser power adjustment and the cooling mode by assigning interlayer dwell time to allow cooling between layers. The switching controller employs a feedback optimization control algorithm for the heating mode to adjust the laser power, and a triggering algorithm that increases the interlayer dwell time until the interlayer temperature reaches the reference value. Additionally, the study compares the performance of the proposed controller in both supported and unsupported overhanging parts to evaluate the effect of support structures on the controller performance as well as the thermal behavior of overhanging parts. Results demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing interlayer temperature across varying cross-sectional areas while remaining within the material's stable processing zone. In the heating mode, the controller efficiently stabilizes temperature, even in geometries with significant cross-section variation. The study also identifies trade-offs among process efficiency, energy consumption, and build time. Supported parts exhibit reduced overheating but consume more energy and material, while unsupported parts stabilize interlayer temperature faster but with longer build times due to increased dwell time assignments. The research highlights notable improvements in interlayer temperature control for geometries prone to excessive thermal stresses. Moreover, the introduction of interlayer dwell time offers a practical solution to maintaining thermal stability in complex geometries."}

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case. However, our most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as such Choquet integrals."}

Thus, we propose a framework that couples the photorealism of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) environments with Adversarial Domain Adaptation.

While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand sensing tasks, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable throughput among all communication users, via joint optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication user scheduling. To address the complicated problem with infinite sensing constraints, we characterize the on-demand detection constraint as a restricted deployment area for UAV and the on-demand localization constraint as Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints over finite reference target points, based on which the original problem is simplified to more tractable one.

The construction strategy for convex problem approximation allows an efficient iterative algorithm with verified convergence to a superior suboptimal solution.

The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component."}

This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement."}

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards.

Personalized trajectories to individual participants were generated using regression models trained on anthropometric, demographic, and walking speed data from a normative database. In a within-subject experiment involving ten unimpaired participants, these personalized trajectories were evaluated in regard to comfort, naturalness, and overall experience and compared against two standard patterns from the same database: one averaging all the trajectories, and one randomly selected. We did not find relevant differences across pattern conditions, despite all trajectories being executed with high accuracy thanks to a stiff position-derivative controller. We found, however, that pattern conditions in later trials were rated as more comfortable and natural than those in the first trial, suggesting that participants might have adapted to walking within the exoskeleton, regardless of the enforced gait pattern. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating subjective feedback when designing personalized gait controllers and accounting for user adaptation during experimentation."}

Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty."}

Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$Δ$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$Δ$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change."}

While recent methods have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate commonsense reasoning and improve exploration efficiency, their planning remains constrained by textual representations, which cannot adequately capture spatial occupancy or scene geometry--critical factors for navigation decisions. We explore whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can achieve mapless visual navigation using only onboard RGB/RGB-D streams, unlocking their potential for spatial perception and planning. We achieve this through an imagination-powered navigation framework, ImagineNav++, which imagines future observation images from candidate robot views and translates navigation planning into a simple best-view image selection problem for VLMs. First, a future-view imagination module distills human navigation preferences to generate semantically meaningful viewpoints with high exploration potential. These imagined views then serve as visual prompts for the VLM to identify the most informative viewpoint. To maintain spatial consistency, we develop a selective foveation memory mechanism, which hierarchically integrates keyframe observations via a sparse-to-dense framework, constructing a compact yet comprehensive memory for long-term spatial reasoning. This approach transforms goal-oriented navigation into a series of tractable point-goal navigation tasks. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object and instance navigation benchmarks show that ImagineNav++ achieves SOTA performance in mapless settings, even surpassing most map-based methods, highlighting the importance of scene imagination and memory in VLM-based spatial reasoning."}

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Built upon a loosely coupled sensor fusion architecture, the system utilizes a novel hybrid Quaternion-focused Error-State EKF/UKF (Qf-ES-EKF/UKF) architecture to process inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This architecture first propagates the entire state using an Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ESKF) and then applies a targeted Scaled Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF) step to refine only the orientation. This sequential process blends the accuracy of SUKF in quaternion estimation with the overall computational efficiency of ESKF. The reliability of visual measurements is assessed via a dynamic sensor confidence score based on metrics, such as image entropy, intensity variation, motion blur, and inference quality, adapting the measurement noise covariance to ensure stable pose estimation even under challenging conditions. Comprehensive experimental analyses on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate key advantages: an average improvement of 49% in position accuracy in challenging scenarios, an average of 57% in rotation accuracy over ESKF-based methods, and SUKF-comparable accuracy achieved with approximately 48% lower computational cost than a full SUKF implementation. These findings demonstrate that the presented approach strikes an effective balance between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy, and significantly enhances UAV pose estimation performance in complex environments with varying sensor reliability."}

Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: \"How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?\". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities. IUS implementation is available at https://github.com/innoisys/ius"}

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction.

Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences.

However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead.

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit."}

Project Website: https://kinematics-aware-diffusion-policy.github.io", "summary": "Whole-body control of robotic manipulators with awareness of full-arm kinematics is crucial for many manipulation scenarios involving body collision avoidance or body-object interactions, which makes it insufficient to consider only the end-effector poses in policy learning. The typical approach for whole-arm manipulation is to learn actions in the robot's joint space. However, the unalignment between the joint space and actual task space (i.e., 3D space) increases the complexity of policy learning, as generalization in task space requires the policy to intrinsically understand the non-linear arm kinematics, which is difficult to learn from limited demonstrations. To address this issue, this letter proposes a kinematics-aware imitation learning framework with consistent task, observation, and action spaces, all represented in the same 3D space. Specifically, we represent both robot states and actions using a set of 3D points on the arm body, naturally aligned with the 3D point cloud observations. This spatially consistent representation improves the policy's sample efficiency and spatial generalizability while enabling full-body control. Built upon the diffusion policy, we further incorporate kinematics priors into the diffusion processes to guarantee the kinematic feasibility of output actions. The joint angle commands are finally calculated through an optimization-based whole-body inverse kinematics solver for execution. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate higher success rates and stronger spatial generalizability of our approach compared to existing methods in body-aware manipulation policy learning."}

Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term \"canon\" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.\n  We present 12 key results.

Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment."}

To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to predict the robot's safety scaling factor directly from process execution data. We analyze multiple neural network architectures and demonstrate that a simple feed-forward network effectively estimates the robot's slowdown. This capability is crucial for improving cycle time predictions and designing more effective scheduling algorithms in collaborative robotic environments."}

To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios."}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off."}

This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning.

Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection."}

These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare."}

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire.

This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction."}

Current workflows compute curvature information during training, discard it, then recompute similar information for merging -- wasting computation and discarding valuable trajectory data. We introduce a unified framework that maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training, then reuses this information for geometry-aware model composition. The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines. The proposed framework exhibits rank-invariant convergence and superior hyperparameter robustness compared to existing low-rank optimizers. By treating the optimization trajectory as a reusable asset rather than discarding it, our approach eliminates redundant computation while enabling more principled model composition."}

The proposed planner integrates the dual quaternion algebra directly into an RRT* framework, thereby enabling natural screw motion interpolation in SE(3). The dual quaternion-based RRT* has been implemented in Python and demonstrated on a representative multi-obstacle scenario. A comparison with a standard RRT* using separate translation and quaternion steering highlights the enhanced pose continuity and obstacle avoidance of the proposed method. The present approach is purely kinematic in nature and does not take into account relative orbital dynamics. Consequently, the resulting path provides a preliminary estimate for a subsequent optimisation-based trajectory planner, which will refine the motion with dynamic constraints for the purpose of practical satellite rendezvous and docking missions."}

Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt."}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining."}

However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)\" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification."}

Project page: https://unistatedlo.github.io", "summary": "Perception of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as cables, ropes, and wires, is the cornerstone for successful downstream manipulation. Although vision-based methods have been extensively explored, they remain highly vulnerable to occlusions that commonly arise in constrained manipulation environments due to surrounding obstacles, large and varying deformations, and limited viewpoints. Moreover, the high dimensionality of the state space, the lack of distinctive visual features, and the presence of sensor noises further compound the challenges of reliable DLO perception. To address these open issues, this paper presents UniStateDLO, the first complete DLO perception pipeline with deep-learning methods that achieves robust performance under severe occlusion, covering both single-frame state estimation and cross-frame state tracking from partial point clouds. Both tasks are formulated as conditional generative problems, leveraging the strong capability of diffusion models to capture the complex mapping between highly partial observations and high-dimensional DLO states. UniStateDLO effectively handles a wide range of occlusion patterns, including initial occlusion, self-occlusion, and occlusion caused by multiple objects. In addition, it exhibits strong data efficiency as the entire network is trained solely on a large-scale synthetic dataset, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real generalization without any real-world training data. Comprehensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that UniStateDLO outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in both estimation and tracking, producing globally smooth yet locally precise DLO state predictions in real time, even under substantial occlusions. Its integration as the front-end module in a closed-loop DLO manipulation system further demonstrates its ability to support stable feedback control in complex, constrained 3-D environments."}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance."}

In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training."}

In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices."}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities."}

Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks.

By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications."}

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy."}

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants."}

This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling."}

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation."}

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions."}

Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy."}

We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination. SMILE enables cells to distributedly balance exploration of unknown channels with exploitation of learned information. We prove that SMILE converges to the optimal stable allocation and achieves logarithmic regret relative to a genie with full knowledge of expected utilities.

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues."}

This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations."}

DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming.

This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving."}

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods."}

We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection.

The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models in improving MedER for Bangla and set the foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP."}

This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset.

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/"}

We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items.

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs."}

Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations.

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincaré ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines. Extensive study shows that our model effectively addresses major challenges, including sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start, while maintaining moderate computational overhead, underscoring its capability for reliable joint QoS prediction."}

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs."}

These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings."}

Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios."}

Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation.

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}."}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators."}

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets."}

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information."}

The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability. These results demonstrate that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of the vast repositories of partially annotated neuroimaging data accumulating worldwide, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy suitable for clinical deployment."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization."}

The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability.

Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment."}

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants."}

The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable.

These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality."}

Accepted at ACRA 2025 (Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation)", "summary": "Interactive reinforcement learning (IRL) has shown promise in enabling autonomous agents and robots to learn complex behaviours from human teachers, yet the dynamics of teacher selection remain poorly understood. This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications."}

To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events."}

The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities."}

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions."}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm."}

Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios."}

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead.

We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels.

Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization."}

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS."}

Code available in https://github.com/jjgonzalez2491/MARLEY_V1", "summary": "Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways."}

However, challenges such as speckle noise, imaging artifacts, irregular lesion morphology, and blurred boundaries severely hinder accurate segmentation. To address these challenges, this work aims to design a robust and efficient model capable of automatically segmenting breast tumors in BUS images.We propose a novel segmentation network named WDFFU-Mamba, which integrates wavelet-guided enhancement and dual-attention feature fusion within a U-shaped Mamba architecture. A Wavelet-denoised High-Frequency-guided Feature (WHF) module is employed to enhance low-level representations through noise-suppressed high-frequency cues. A Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is also introduced to effectively merge skip-connected and semantic features, improving contextual consistency.Extensive experiments on two public BUS datasets demonstrate that WDFFU-Mamba achieves superior segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of Dice coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).The combination of wavelet-domain enhancement and attention-based fusion greatly improves both the accuracy and robustness of BUS image segmentation, while maintaining computational efficiency.The proposed WDFFU-Mamba model not only delivers strong segmentation performance but also exhibits desirable generalization ability across datasets, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications in breast tumor ultrasound analysis."}

However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks."}

We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models."}

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios."}

Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications."}

However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - \"we know it when we see it\". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks."}

To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior.

Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility.

To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic.

In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \\emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function.

This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component."}

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis."}

Code available in https://github.com/jjgonzalez2491/MARLEY_V1", "summary": "Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways."}

To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance."}

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving."}

We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems.

OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in ODISR."}

However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results."}

A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization."}

It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts. The full dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/raidium/RadImageNet-VQA."}

To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm.

However, for their outputs to get accepted in practice, the results they provide should be explainable in a way easily understood by pathologists. A well-known and widely used explanation technique is occlusion, which, however, can take a long time to compute, thus slowing the development and interaction with pathologists. In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs. This speedup enables rapid iteration in model development and debugging and brings us closer to adopting AI-assisted prostate cancer detection in clinical settings. We propose that our approach to finding the replacement for occlusion can be used to evaluate candidate methods in other related applications."}

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images.

Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM."}

Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables scalable, personalized segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements."}

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning."}

An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs."}

LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs. The code and data will be released upon publication."}

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources."}

In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.\n  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment.

On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy.

This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources."}

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests."}

To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps.

Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images.

Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

Our dataset contains synchronized, calibrated and annotated data captured by sensors of different modalities, such as RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR, etc. The dataset is aimed at developing supervised methods that can extract useful information from these modalities in order to provide a high quality of scene interpretation regardless of potentially poor visibility conditions. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed dataset, we evaluate several multimodal methods on our difficult nighttime test set. We present training approaches that enable multimodal methods to be trained in a more robust way, thus enabling them to retain reliable performance even in near-complete darkness.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Existing deep learning models lack flexibility to handle dynamic network configurations. Furthermore, many approaches overlook pilot contamination and suffer from high computational complexity.

Our model is architecture-agnostic to users load, handles both clustering and power allocation without channel estimation overhead, and eliminates pilot contamination by assigning users to AP within a pilot reuse constraint. We also incorporate a customized linear attention mechanism to capture user-AP interactions efficiently and enable linear scalability with respect to the number of users. Numerical results confirm the model's effectiveness in maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency and providing near-optimal performance while ensuring adaptability and scalability in dynamic scenarios."}

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments."}

In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance."}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns.

Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection."}

This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors."}

Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.\n  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.\n  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels. However, these learning methods are not well understood for models with multiple outputs.\n  This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for models with multiple outputs. The method is based on the additional rotations and flipping, and does not assume the probabilistic nature of the model's responses.

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters. By decoupling training from HR qMRI requirement, our framework enables fast qMRI acquisitions enhanced via routine clinical images, offering a practical pathway for integrating quantitative relaxometry into clinical workflows with acceptable additional scan time."}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants.

In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following.

To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation.

While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection."}

While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \\ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training.

This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS).

These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists."}

The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation.

Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases."}

Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications."}

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence."}

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication."}

However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models."}

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants.

In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines.

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/"}

These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors."}

Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions."}

This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning."}

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components."}

Built upon a loosely coupled sensor fusion architecture, the system utilizes a novel hybrid Quaternion-focused Error-State EKF/UKF (Qf-ES-EKF/UKF) architecture to process inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This architecture first propagates the entire state using an Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ESKF) and then applies a targeted Scaled Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF) step to refine only the orientation. This sequential process blends the accuracy of SUKF in quaternion estimation with the overall computational efficiency of ESKF. The reliability of visual measurements is assessed via a dynamic sensor confidence score based on metrics, such as image entropy, intensity variation, motion blur, and inference quality, adapting the measurement noise covariance to ensure stable pose estimation even under challenging conditions. Comprehensive experimental analyses on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate key advantages: an average improvement of 49% in position accuracy in challenging scenarios, an average of 57% in rotation accuracy over ESKF-based methods, and SUKF-comparable accuracy achieved with approximately 48% lower computational cost than a full SUKF implementation.
