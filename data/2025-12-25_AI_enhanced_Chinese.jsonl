Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u957f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u6863\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u878d\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMilaps\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u60012D\u8fde\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u79fb\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u60012D\u8fde\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\uff08\u6e90\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u800c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u79bb\u6563\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMilaps\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65c5\u884c\u9001\u8d27\u5458\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Milaps\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u79fb\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision.

Kramer", "Rudranarayan M. Mukherjee"], "title": "A General Purpose Method for Robotic Interception of Non-Cooperative Dynamic Targets", "comment": "10 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables. Accepted to IEEE Aerospace Conference 2026", "summary": "This paper presents a general purpose framework for autonomous, vision-based interception of dynamic, non-cooperative targets, validated across three distinct mobility platforms: an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a four-wheeled ground rover, and an air-thruster spacecraft testbed. The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions.

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u884c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u52a8\u4f5c\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u5faa\u73af\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u653e\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u9a71\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6536\u655b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u5373\u53ef\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f"}}

A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences.

To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6c34\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u673a\u4e09\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u673a\u5728\u5f3a\u6d0b\u6d41\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5bfc\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6ed1\u6a21\u5e72\u6270\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eiLOS\u5236\u5bfc\u5f8b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6ed1\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u6c34\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u673a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u822a\u8def\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u4e0b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation.

Matha", "Aya Fahmy", "Rui Song", "Daniel Cremers", "Henri Meess"], "title": "OccuFly: A 3D Vision Benchmark for Semantic Scene Completion from the Aerial Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort.

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u4e92\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136CoT\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u8fd8\u662f\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u622a\u65ad\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemma-3-4B-IT\u548cLLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Gemma-3-1B-IT\u548cLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\u8fdb\u884c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u622a\u65ad\u9608\u503c\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u4e92\u6362\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528PRM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or \"tinkering\".

Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b56\u5c55\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b56\u5c55\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u548c\u836f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u533b\u9662\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u961f\u5217\uff08N=184\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cGKC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747AUROC\u4e3a0.803\uff0895% CI: 0.799-0.807\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aefTransformer\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4ef7\u503c", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u5c06LLMs\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b56\u5c55\u5f15\u64ce\u800c\u975e\u9ed1\u76d2\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u80bf\u7624\u5b66AI\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8def\u5f84"}}

A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u66b4\u9732\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6545\u969c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5224\u522b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u4e09\u6b21\u5bf9\u6297\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9886\u57df\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories.

In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple \"scene\" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM.

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d45\u5c42\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u524d3-5\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fatoken\u7684\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u9057\u5fd8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7834\u574f\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u5b9a\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d45\u5c42\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u8de8token\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf(0-1\u5c3a\u5ea6)\uff1b(2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b(3) \u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6062\u590d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff1b(4) \u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784(Qwen2.5-3B\u5230Qwen2.5-32B)\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523086.2-90.6%\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c06\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.3-7.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u9057\u5fd8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u4f46\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u591a\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3001\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u7279\u6709\u7684\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u793c\u8c8c\u8bed\u8a00\u5219\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 \u03bcm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting.

Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ROME\u3001IKE\u3001WISE\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u9057\u5fd8\u8303\u56f4\u754c\u5b9a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ROME\u3001IKE\u3001WISE\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u9700\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u9057\u5fd8\u8303\u56f4\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities.

These issues severely constrain sustained dialogue and personalized services. This paper proposes the Memory Bear system, which constructs a human-like memory architecture grounded in cognitive science principles. By integrating multimodal information perception, dynamic memory maintenance, and adaptive cognitive services, Memory Bear achieves a full-chain reconstruction of LLM memory mechanisms. Across domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and education, Memory Bear demonstrates substantial engineering innovation and performance breakthroughs. It significantly improves knowledge fidelity and retrieval efficiency in long-term conversations, reduces hallucination rates, and enhances contextual adaptability and reasoning capability through memory-cognition integration. Experimental results show that, compared with existing solutions (e.g., Mem0, MemGPT, Graphiti), Memory Bear outperforms them across key metrics, including accuracy, token efficiency, and response latency.

Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice.

On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA.

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u6807\u8bb0", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u6280\u672f", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u804c\u4e1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u504f\u89c1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u79fb\u9664\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u5148\u9a8c\u5d29\u6e83\"\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u6574\u4f53\u504f\u89c1", "conclusion": "\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565"}}

While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models.

To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data.

While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u4f1a\u56e0\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bef\u5bfc\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u4e3a\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u53d8\u540e\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2aLLMs\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u62b5\u6297\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u770b\u4f3c\u6b63\u786e\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ecd\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u5207\u3002"}}

ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.\n  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.\n  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIVE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u8bb2\u5ea7\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bb2\u5ea7\u89c6\u9891\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6f84\u6e05\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u60d1\u65f6\u53ea\u80fd\u5916\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb2\u5ea7\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u89e3\u91ca\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "ALIVE\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7ASR\u8f6c\u5f55\u3001LLM\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u8bb2\u5ea7\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff1b3) \u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6682\u505c\u3001\u6587\u672c/\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u95ee\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6216\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3001FAISS\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u8868\u660e\uff0cALIVE\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIVE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5982\u4f55\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f55\u5236\u8bb2\u5ea7\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAFA\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u5e38\u89c1\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f4e\u9891\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236(AFA)\uff1a1) \u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u63a9\u7801\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\u6b3a\u9a97\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff1b2) \u5224\u522b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528Transformer\u5bf9token\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97state-of-the-art\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u83b7\u5f9712.6%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "AFA\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u81ea\u52a8\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b"}}

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features.

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u61d2\u60f0\uff08\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u524d\u622a\u65ad\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u9075\u5b88\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff08\u56e0\u77ed\u89c6\u89e3\u7801\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u4f18\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\uff08\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u61d2\u60f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5728200\u8f6e\u6df7\u4e71\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u610f\u5916\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u61d2\u60f0\uff08\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u524d\u622a\u65ad\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u9075\u5b88\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff08\u56e0\u77ed\u89c6\u89e3\u7801\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u4f18\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\uff08\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08A\u3001B\u3001C\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\uff08OpenAI GPT-4\u53d8\u4f53\u548cDeepSeek\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8cA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8cB\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8cC\u901a\u8fc7200\u8f6e\u6df7\u4e71\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u61d2\u60f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u7701\u7565\u5fc5\u9700\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b54\u6848\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b3\uff09\u5728200\u8f6e\u6df7\u4e71\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u610f\u5916\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u9075\u5b88\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u61d2\u60f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models.

MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "MediEval\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u63a5\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u533b\u5b66LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u8c61\u9650\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faCoRFu\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u5b64\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u533b\u5b66\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8bc4\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u5b66LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaMediEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u8fde\u63a5MIMIC-IV\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eUMLS\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b2. \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u533b\u5b66\u9648\u8ff0\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u56db\u8c61\u9650\u6846\u67b6\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51faCoRFu\uff08\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eDPO\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u5e7b\u89c9\u652f\u6301\u548c\u771f\u76f8\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u6709\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aLLM\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b2.

SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking.

Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)", "summary": "Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u7269\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8c03\u8282\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u7269\u4f53\u88ab\u591a\u4e2a\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u7eb5\u3001\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u4e14\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5c31\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u5feb\u901f\u8c03\u8282\u6293\u63e1\u529b\uff0c\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u6709\u9650\u4f20\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u7269\u4f53\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u89e6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u80fd\u91cf\u5bb9\u5668\u3002\u624b\u6307\u65bd\u52a0\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a8\u65ad\u6ed1\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ece\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6ed1\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8-\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5ef6\u957f\u6293\u63e1\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u7269\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u89e6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6293\u63e1\u529b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u6216\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\\% and 60.5\\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively.

Unlike most existing elastic tube-based MPC methods, we do not assume perfect knowledge of the system model or disturbance realizations bounds. Instead, a conservative zonotopic disturbance set is initialized and iteratively refined using data and prior knowledge: data are used to identify matrix zonotope model sets for the system dynamics, while prior physical knowledge is employed to discard models and disturbances inconsistent with known constraints. This process yields constrained matrix zonotopes representing disturbance realizations and dynamics that enable a principled fusion of offline information with limited online data, improving MPC feasibility and performance. The proposed design leverages closed-loop system characterization to learn and refine control gains that maintain a small tube size. By separating open-loop model mismatch from closed-loop effects in the error dynamics, the method avoids dependence on the size of the state and input operating regions, thereby reducing conservatism. An adaptive co-design of the tube and ancillary feedback ensures $\u03bb$-contractive zonotopic tubes, guaranteeing robust positive invariance, improved feasibility margins, and enhanced disturbance tolerance. We establish recursive feasibility conditions and introduce a polyhedral Lyapunov candidate for the error tube, proving exponential stability of the closed-loop error dynamics under the adaptive tube-gain updates. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness, enlarged feasibility regions, and safe closed-loop performance using only a small amount of online data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f39\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u7ba1\u9053MPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u754c\u5b8c\u5168\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684zonotopic\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u5316\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u77e9\u9635zonotope\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7528\u4e8e\u5254\u9664\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u5206\u79bb\u5f00\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u540c\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u03bb-\u6536\u7f29zonotopic\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u591a\u9762\u4f53Lyapunov\u5019\u9009\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u95ed\u73af\u8bef\u5dee\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7ba1\u9053MPC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u878d\u5408\u51cf\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it.

Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLGGD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6293\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u6267\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6293\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLGGD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u5377\u79ef\u5934(LDCH)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5377\u79ef\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b3) \u6700\u7ec8\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OCID-VLG\u548cGrasp-Anything++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLGGD\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LGGD\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u89c6\u89c9\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\"\u4e3b\u5bfcvs\u88ab\u4e3b\u5bfc\"\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3b\u5bfc\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3b\u5bfc\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\"\u4e3b\u5bfcvs\u88ab\u4e3b\u5bfc\"\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86DominanceBench\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5934\u90e8\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e3b\u5bfctoken\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u9971\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6token\u3002\u5934\u90e8\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eDvD\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5934\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5d29\u6e83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions.

Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research.

Existing approaches to evaluating pedestrian environments often rely on static, infrastructure-based indices or retrospective surveys, which overlook the dynamic, subjective, and psychophysiological dimensions of everyday walking experience. This paper introduces a multimodal, human-centered framework for assessing pedestrian well-being in the wild by integrating three complementary data streams: continuous physiological sensing, geospatial tracking, and momentary self-reports collected using the Experience Sampling Method. The framework conceptualizes pedestrian experience as a triangulation enabling a holistic understanding of how urban environments influence well-being. The utility of our framework is then demonstrated through a naturalistic case study conducted in the Greater Philadelphia region, in which participants wore research-grade wearable sensors and carried GPS-enabled smartphones during their regular daily activities. Physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability and electrodermal activity, were synchronized with spatial trajectories and in situ self-reports of stress, affect, and perceived infrastructure conditions. Results illustrate substantial inter- and intra-individual variability in both subjective experience and physiological response, as well as context-dependent patterns associated with traffic exposure, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and environmental enclosure. The findings also suggest that commonly used walkability indices may not fully capture experiential dimensions of pedestrian well-being. By enabling real-world, multimodal measurement of pedestrian experience, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for advancing human-centered urban analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u751f\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u4eba\u798f\u7949\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u798f\u7949\u662f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u5b9c\u5c45\u57ce\u5e02\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6307\u6807\u6216\u56de\u987e\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65e5\u5e38\u6b65\u884c\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u751f\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7406\u4f20\u611f\uff08\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\uff09\u3001\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08GPS\uff09\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53d6\u6837\u6cd5\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\uff08\u538b\u529b\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8d39\u57ce\u5730\u533a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4f69\u6234\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548cGPS\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u751f\u7406\u53cd\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u66b4\u9732\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5c01\u95ed\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6b65\u884c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u884c\u4eba\u798f\u7949\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4eba\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8303\u56f4\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u4e862023-2025\u5e74\u95f432\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece259\u9879\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u62bd\u683732\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff082023-2025\u5e74\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e94\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6750\u6599\u3001\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3001AI\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u91c7\u7528\"\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5148\u6307\u5bfc\"\u3001\"\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u7559\"\u3001\"\u6e10\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u9636\u68af\"\u548c\"\u5de5\u4ef6\u57fa\u7840\"\uff08\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u804a\u5929\u754c\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5171\u4eab\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8f85\u5bfc\u3001\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u652f\u67b6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5927\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u751f\u4ea7\u6027\u6323\u624e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bd5\u70b9\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u5316\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u62a4\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b010%-30%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u800c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "1) \u521b\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u5f20\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2) \u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548cVLM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528VLM\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b2) \u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u800c\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5c06VLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710%-30%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aVLMs\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8VLM\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To allow for nonlinear dynamic control under this constraint, a method for representing a state-space system model as an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX model) is proposed. With the input as well as the output of the plant encrypted and transmitted to the controller, the reformulated ARX form can compute each output using only a finite number of operations, from its several previous inputs and outputs. Existence of a stable observer for the controller is a key condition for the proposed representation. The representation replaces the controller with an observer form and applies a method similar to finite-impulse-response approximation. It is verified that the approximation error and its effect can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of a parameter, under stability of the observer and the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aARX\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u52a0\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e26\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARX\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c31\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6709\u9650\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u5c0f\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ARX\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u9012\u5f52\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u6570\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728MuJoCo MPC\uff08MJPC\uff09\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528WASP\u5bfc\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82\u500d\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "MJPC\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u73b0\u6210\u7684MPC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8", "method": "\u5728MJPC\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165Web of Affine Spaces\uff08WASP\uff09\u5bfc\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002WASP\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u65b0\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97", "result": "WASP\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMJPC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08\u5982iLQG\uff09\u914d\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4FD\u540e\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8eMJPC\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u89c4\u5212\u5668", "conclusion": "WASP\u5bfc\u6570\u662fMJPC\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408MPC\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u96c6\u6210WASP\u7684MJPC\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76"}}

This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(CVAE)\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u4e13\u4e1a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff08\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff09\u3001\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u6790\u76ee\u7684\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u666e\u904d\uff08\u60a3\u8005\u68c0\u67e5\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\u7b49\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(CVAE)\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u8bca\u65ad\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d1f\u8377\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCVAE\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance.

Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting.

In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25.

Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "DCCF\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a00\u91ca\u4e86\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u9020\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\uff08DCCF\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0cDCCF\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fed\u4ee3\u6781\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCCF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.52%\u3002", "conclusion": "DCCF\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bfb\u6c42\u548c\u653e\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u90a3\u6837\u6291\u5236\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4f2a\u9020\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion.

We show that, under an appropriate nonlinear small-gain condition, the overall interconnected system inherits the FxT-ISS property. In this sense, the proposed result complements existing Lyapunov-based smallgain theorems for asymptotic and finite-time stability, and enables a systematic analysis of interconnection structures exhibiting fixed-time stability. To illustrate the applicability of the theory, we study feedback-based optimization problems with time-varying cost functions, and Nash-equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games with nonlinear dynamical plants in the loop. For both problems, we present a class of non-smooth gradient or pseudogradient-based controllers that achieve fixed-time convergence without requiring time-scale separation and using real-time feedback.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8d1f\u9762\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7ee9\u6548\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u8ffd\u6c42\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b40\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9aKPI\u6302\u94a9\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u5305\u542b\"\u6307\u4ee4\u5f3a\u5236\"\u548c\"\u6fc0\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\"\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u670d\u4ece\u6027\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u768412\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ece1.3%\u523071.4%\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d9\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u7387\u572830%\u523050%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemini-3-Pro-Preview\uff09\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u8d85\u8fc760%\uff09\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3KPI\u800c\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\"\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\"\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96c6\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5ba4\u5916\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u52a8\u7269\u7fa4\u4f53\u96c6\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5f00\u53d1\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u96c6\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ec5\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u90bb\u5c45\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u4e24\u79cd\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7ed8\u5236\u76f8\u56fe\u63ed\u793a\u96c6\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5ba4\u5916\u5341\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u96c6\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6025\u5267\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u6781\u5316\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u80fd\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u9762\u5bf9\u5165\u4fb5\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6267\u884c\u96c6\u4f53\u8f6c\u5411\u3001\u77ac\u6001\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u79d2\u5185\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u5c0f\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u5219\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u8c03\u8282\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8c03\u8282\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6062\u590d\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u3002"}}

However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyDRA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u79e9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u56fa\u5b9a\u79e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u79fb\u52a8VLM\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyDRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1)\u5206\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u79e9\u5206\u914d+\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u5185\u79e9\u8c03\u6574\uff09\uff1b2)\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u79e9\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHyDRA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53474.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "HyDRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u79e9\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8VLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment.

The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSchr\u00f6dinger's Navigator\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef63D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u60f3\u8c61\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u601d\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u4e09\u6761\u5019\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef63D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u60f3\u8c61\u6bcf\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u60f3\u8c61\u76843D\u89c2\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u906e\u6321\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u66f4\u597d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Go2\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9759\u6001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u4e09\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cSchr\u00f6dinger's Navigator\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef63D\u60f3\u8c61\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u60f3\u8c61\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u906e\u6321\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7ed5\u884c\u6216\u5bc6\u96c6\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u56fe\u3002"}}

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance.

Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them.

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548cRNA\u7b49\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6559\u4f1a\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "REM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u6f14\u8fdb\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u8f6e\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff08\u94fe\u5f0f\u9000\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u7ebf\u7d22\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u65f6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5305\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\uff08REM\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5305\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5305\u56f4\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efaRealChain\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53ca\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cREM\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.5%\uff1b\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u7684RealChain\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5960\u5b9a\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "REM\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4f2a\u5f71\u8f6c\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5355\u5411\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Beta-Bernoulli\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u548cRAG\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\"\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\"\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u53ea\u80fd\u5355\u5411\u6d88\u8d39\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u505c\u6ede\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6982\u7387\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u8bc1\u660e\u5916\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u9057\u5fd8\u56e0\u5b50\u03b3\u7684Beta-Bernoulli\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u547d\u9898\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff1b2. \u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u52a8\u673a\uff1a\u7a33\u6001\u52a8\u673a\uff08\u7ef4\u6301\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u7cca\u70b9\uff09\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u56e0\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u5934\u90e8\uff1b4. \u5c06\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u7528\u4f5cRLHF\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548cSFT\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5f02\u6784\uff08Zipfian\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u516c\u5171\u8d21\u732e\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u5206\u4eab\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u8eab\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u5229\u4ed6\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6362\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3aRLHF\u548cSFT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data.

We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies.

Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large.

Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges.

However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%).

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4SFT\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136RLVR\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u8f74\uff08\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\uff1a\u5173\u8054\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1a\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528RLVR\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5bf9Qwen-2.5-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff083B-32B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u53d8\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4SFT\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u8de8\u7ea7\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002RLVR\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0cRLVR\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4ec5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLVR\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats.

This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data.

This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints.

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.\n  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a \"quality function\" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings.

Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u5bb9\u6613\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u5f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdf\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u7528LLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u66ff\u6362\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ea\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u8a00\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u89d2\u8272\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u662f\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002LLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u66ff\u6362\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u5f53(i)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdf\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c(ii)\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u6216\u6765\u6e90\u65f6\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u66ff\u6362\u53ea\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u89d2\u8272\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528LLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u66ff\u6362\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ea\u662f\u9762\u677f\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u8a00\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4f7f\u89d2\u8272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u540c\u6837\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u805a\u5408\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u89d2\u8272\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows.

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions.

While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations.

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative.

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u771f\u5b9eNHS\u521d\u7ea7\u4fdd\u5065\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u836f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u5e8a\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec546.9%\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u836f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e38\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\uff0c\u6216\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u8d8a\u8868\u9762\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9eNHS\u521d\u7ea7\u4fdd\u5065\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u67e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56de\u987e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8986\u76d6NHS Cheshire\u548cMerseyside\u5730\u533a2,125,549\u540d\u6210\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u62bd\u6837\u60a3\u8005\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u836f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6392\u9664\u540e\u83b7\u5f97277\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5ba1\u67e5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u5e8a\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff08\u654f\u611f\u6027100%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602783.1%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u572846.9%\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3001\u672a\u6839\u636e\u60a3\u8005\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u6574\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u5357\u3001\u8bef\u89e3\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f2\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection.

This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIPIM\u539f\u8bed\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfSDF\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff08\u6700\u591a70\u500d\uff09", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8001\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5316\u4f7f\u5f97\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5212\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u867d\u7136\u5feb\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecfSDF\uff09\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u539f\u8bed\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u9891\u7e41\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u5957\u540d\u4e3aIPIM\uff08Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models\uff09\u7684\u539f\u8bed\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfSDF\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b9200\u4e07\u4e2a\u4e09\u89d2\u7f51\u683c\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u914d\u5408IPIM\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1170\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "IPIM\u539f\u8bed\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecfSDF\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning.

Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\\times$ speedups and $3\\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u53bb\u566a\u71b5\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\"\u53bb\u566a\u71b5\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u540e\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06MDMs\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ece\u8d1f\u62c5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function.

In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives.

Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking.

However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation.

Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image.

This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "RevFFN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eMoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006Transformer\u5757\u91cd\u6784\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355GPU\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLMs\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5982DeepSpeed\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u591aGPU\u5185\u5b58\u6216CPU\u5378\u8f7d\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RevFFN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9006Transformer\u5757\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u671f\u95f4\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u5230\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301MoE\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "RevFFN\u4e3aMoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355GPU\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8425\u9500\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba2\u9605\u5b9a\u4ef7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6709\u62a4\u680f\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7ec6\u5206\u4ef7\u683c\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u5931\u503e\u5411\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u5165\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u7559\u5b58\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6da8\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u5165\u635f\u5931\u6216\u5ba2\u6237\u6d41\u5931\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u5165\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ef7\u683c\u654f\u611f\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6620\u5c04\u98ce\u9669\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u5e95\u7ebf\u548c\u5141\u8bb8\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u7b49\u4e1a\u52a1\u62a4\u680f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316API\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f02\u6784SaaS\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6da8\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ef7\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5230\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ec6\u5206\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ef7\u683c\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6708\u5ea6\u7ecf\u5e38\u6027\u6536\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u9053\u5fb7\u62a4\u680f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u6cdb\u51fd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5c40\u57df\u52bf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6cdb\u51fd\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u6cdb\u51fd\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u6216\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wetterich\u548cWilson-Polchinski\u7b49\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5c40\u57df\u52bf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u573a\u6784\u578b\u5982\u77ac\u5b50\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "T2AV-Compass\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b500\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6307\u6807\u6216\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa500\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5ba2\u89c2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2MLLM-as-a-Judge\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027T2AV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "T2AV-Compass\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power.

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f53\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u800c\u975e\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u90a3\u6837\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u800c\u975e\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8d22\u4ea7\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fdAI\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fdAI\u5728\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step.

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized \"spiky\" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing \"balanced\" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\"\u5c16\u5cf0\"\u8868\u5f81\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\"\u5e73\u8861\"\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6837\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u5c42ReLU\u53bb\u566a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(DAE)\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u51fa\u8868\u5f81\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a(i)\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\"\u5c16\u5cf0\"\u8868\u5f81\uff1b(ii)\u6cdb\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\"\u5e73\u8861\"\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u8fd8\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research.

However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoSeNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u6700\u4f18\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u56db\u5c42\u7b97\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ML\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoSeNet\u56db\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u5c42\u3001\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u5c42\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5c42\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u53e0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "CoSeNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5272\u53ca\u5176\u5206\u5272\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CoSeNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6298\u8877\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain.

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists.

For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns.

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8026\u5408\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8026\u5408\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u76d1\u63a7\u6307\u6807\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4) \u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u540e\u7aef\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources.

Kevrekidis", "Eleni Chatzi"], "title": "A Mechanistic Analysis of Transformers for Dynamical Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTransformer\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u8003\u8651\u901a\u7528\u6216\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa", "method": "\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u632f\u8361\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eTransformer\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u89c1\u89e3"}}

Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.", "AI": {"tldr": "VisRes Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u8fd8\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u8a00\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VisRes Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff1aLevel 1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u611f\u77e5\u8865\u5168\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff08\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\uff09\uff1bLevel 2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u989c\u8272\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\uff1bLevel 3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc719,000\u5f20\u53d7\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u572819,000\u591a\u5f20\u53d7\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9664\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002VisRes\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5176\u5404\u4e2a\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "VisRes\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63a8\u8fdb\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what \"useful\" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3LMMs\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u8bb0\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u6ce8\u5e76\u4ee5\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e2d\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u96be\u4ee5\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LMMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

Using the computational efficiency of generalized eigenvalue decomposition and the generalization benefits of Universum learning, the proposed models address critical challenges in EEG analysis: non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data. U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure. IU-GEPSVM achieves peak accuracies of 85% (O vs S) and 80% (Z vs S), with mean accuracies of 81.29% and 77.57% respectively, outperforming baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdUniversum\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1aU-GEPSVM\u548cIU-GEPSVM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548cUniversum\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728Bonn\u5927\u5b66\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdUniversum\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8fd1\u7aef\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff1aU-GEPSVM\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u503c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6574\u5408Universum\u7ea6\u675f\uff1bIU-GEPSVM\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u5dee\u5206\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u548cUniversum\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bonn\u5927\u5b66\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1aO vs S\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u95ed\u773cvs\u766b\u75eb\uff09\u548cZ vs S\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u7741\u773cvs\u766b\u75eb\uff09\u3002IU-GEPSVM\u5728(O vs S)\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523085%\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c81.29%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728(Z vs S)\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523080%\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c77.57%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Universum\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548cUniversum\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "SegMo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5c0f\u7247\u6bb5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728HumanML3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e860.553\u7684TOP 1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7247\u6bb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u5bf9\u9f50\u5355\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "SegMo\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a(1)\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u53d6\uff1a\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77ed\u8bed\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b(2)\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u53d6\uff1a\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b(3)\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c-\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cSegMo\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728HumanML3D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.553\u7684\u6539\u8fdbTOP 1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0cSegMo\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "SegMo\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content.

Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization.

Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faACD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f3D\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u5e03\u5c40\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\uff08ACD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f3D\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u5e03\u5c40\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Layout ControlNet\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cACD\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "ACD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context.

While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker.

This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u683c\u884c\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u635f\u5931\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u884c\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5cf0\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u56fe\u50cf\u5750\u6807\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728PubLayNet-1M\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TableNet\u548cPyTesseract OCR\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5217\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA)\u4ece67%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523076%\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u586b\u5145\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u5374\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u5584\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4eba\u4eec\u5e38\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff1f", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b2. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u5206\u6790\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\uff1b5. \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u53d7\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u76ca\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TICON\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u5207\u7247\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u5c0f\u5207\u7247\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5207\u7247\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u53d6\u8131\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5207\u7247\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5207\u7247\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u4efb\u4f55\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u3002", "method": "TICON\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u75c5\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6765\u81ea\u4efb\u4f55\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "TICON\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08HEST-Bench\u3001THUNDER\u3001CATCH\uff09\u548c\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Patho-Bench\uff09\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec511K\u4e2aWSI\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684TICON\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8fbe350K\u4e2aWSI\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "TICON\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684Transformer-based tile representation contextualizer\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684token\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347SAM2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u51cf\u5c11token\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "SAM2\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u89c9token\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5176\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u6b21\u5185\u5b58\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684token\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u4e4b\u540e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5bf9token\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4ece\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684token\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u540etoken\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u672a\u526a\u679d\u7684SAM2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe42.50%\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e37.41%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684J\u548cF\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e9\u671ftoken\u9009\u62e9\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u5e95\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss.
