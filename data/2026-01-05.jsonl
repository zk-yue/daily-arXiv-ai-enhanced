While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence."}

While previous work has attempted to address this issue by steering the model using guidance mechanisms, or by generating a large pool of candidates and refining them, in this work we take a different direction and aim for diversity in generations via noise optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model. We also analyze the frequency characteristics of the noise and show that alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles can improve both optimization and search. Our experiments demonstrate that noise optimization yields superior results in terms of generation quality and variety."}

To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning.

In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing water extent mapping using deep learning models. This approach is particularly beneficial when timely post-flood observations, acquired during or shortly after the flood peak, are limited, as it enables the use of all available imagery for more accurate post-flood water extent mapping. However, the adaptive integration of partially available MSI data into the SAR-based post-flood water extent mapping process remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet), a multimodal deep learning model that utilizes SAR data as the primary input for post-flood water extent mapping and integrates complementary MSI data through feature fusion. In experiments on the C2S-MS Floods dataset, SMAGNet consistently outperformed other multimodal deep learning models in prediction performance across varying levels of MSI data availability. Furthermore, we found that even when MSI data were completely missing, the performance of SMAGNet remained statistically comparable to that of a U-Net model trained solely on SAR data. These findings indicate that SMAGNet enhances the model robustness to missing data as well as the applicability of multimodal deep learning in real-world flood management scenarios."}

Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \\times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \\times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings."}

This paper investigates the influence of clustering on the observability and controllability of complex SF networks, framing these characteristics in the context of structured systems theory. In this paper, we show that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes due to better information propagation within clusters. This relationship is of interest for optimizing network design in applications such as social networks and intelligent transportation systems. We first quantify the network observability/controllability requirements, and then, through Monte-Carlo simulations and different case studies, we show how clustering affects these metrics. Our findings offer practical insights into reducing control and observer nodes for sensor/actuator placement, particularly in resource-constrained setups.

Compact, interpretable rules are distilled from failure traces and injected into the prompt during inference to improve task performance. These rules are proposed by the LLM itself and consolidated using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) objective that favors generality and conciseness. Each rule is stored in both natural language and a structured symbolic form, supporting efficient retrieval at inference time. Experiments on tool-use benchmarks show that this approach improves accuracy on both seen and unseen tools without modifying LLM weights. It outperforms prompting-based adaptation methods and complements finetuning. Moreover, rules learned from one LLM can be reused to improve others, including long reasoning LLMs, highlighting the portability of symbolic knowledge across architectures."}

In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses."}

An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments."}

This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this \\emph{mode averaging} problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing. More details: https://cdgsearch.github.io/"}

The heterogeneous robots are equipped with different sensors, e.g., long-range lidars for fast exploration and close-range cameras for detailed inspection. Furthermore, global communication is often unavailable in such environments, where the robots can only communicate with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks when they are in close proximity and free of obstruction.

To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined.

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon."}

A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models.

Previous efforts for perching on vertical surfaces have predominantly focused on lightweight mechanical design solutions with relatively scant system-level integration. Furthermore, perching strategies for vertical surfaces commonly require high-speed, aggressive landing operations that are dangerous for a surveyor drone with sensitive electronics onboard. This work presents the preliminary investigation of a perching approach suitable for larger drones that both gently perches on vertical tree trunks and reacts and recovers from perch failures. The system in this work, called SLAP, consists of vision-based perch site detector, an IMU (inertial-measurement-unit)-based perch failure detector, an attitude controller for soft perching, an optical close-range detection system, and a fast active elastic gripper with microspines made from commercially-available slapbands. We validated this approach on a modified 1.2 kg commercial quadrotor with component and system analysis. Initial human-in-the-loop autonomous indoor flight experiments achieved a 75% perch success rate on a real oak tree segment across 20 flights, and 100% perch failure recovery across 2 flights with induced failures."}

Often, networked control systems experience packet dropouts, leading to open-loop behavior that significantly affects the behavior of the system. Similarly, in real-time control applications, control tasks frequently experience computational overruns and thus occasionally no new actuator command is issued. This article addresses the safety verification and controller synthesis problem for a class of control systems subject to weakly-hard constraints, i.e., a set of window-based constraints where the number of failures are bounded within a given time horizon. The results are based on a new notion of graph-based barrier functions that are specifically tailored to the considered system class, offering a set of constraints whose satisfaction leads to safety guarantees despite communication failures. Subsequent reformulations of the safety constraints are proposed to alleviate conservatism and improve computational tractability, and the resulting trade-offs are discussed. Finally, several numerical case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

First, conversational context is paramount, with performance saturating rapidly -- 90\\% of the total gain achieved within just the most recent 10--30 preceding turns (depending on the label set). Second, hierarchical sentence representations help at utterance-level, but this benefit disappears once conversational context is provided, suggesting that context subsumes intra-utterance structure.

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain."}

Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.\n  Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions.

To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics. This fully verifies its effectiveness and versatility in fine-grained multi-attribute face region-focal analysis scenarios."}

Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers."}

To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates."}

Despite recent progress, existing TKG reasoning models typically rely on large parameter sizes and intensive computation, leading to high hardware costs and energy consumption. These constraints hinder their deployment on resource-constrained, low-power, and distributed platforms that require real-time inference. Moreover, most existing model compression and distillation techniques are designed for static knowledge graphs and fail to adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in TKGs, often resulting in degraded reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose a distillation framework specifically tailored for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Our approach leverages large language models as teacher models to guide the distillation process, enabling effective transfer of both structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. By integrating large-scale public knowledge with task-specific temporal information, the proposed framework enhances the student model's ability to model temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and efficient architecture.

We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design."}

Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control."}

Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission.

A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication.

We present a generalizable strategy for adapting EBM to graph-based RAG, integrating the PICO framework into knowledge graph construction and retrieval, and proposing a Bayesian-inspired reranking algorithm to calibrate ranking scores by evidence grade without introducing predefined weights. We validated this framework in sports rehabilitation, a literature-rich domain currently lacking RAG systems and benchmarks.

These items range from easy-to-pick, single-piece food items to flexible, long and cluttered ones. We propose a replaceable bit-based gripper system to tackle the challenge of weight-based handling of cluttered food items. The gripper features specialized food attachments(bits) that enhance its grasping capabilities, and a belt replacement system allows switching between different food items during packaging operations. It offers a wide range of control options, enabling it to grasp and drop specific weights of granular, cluttered, and entangled foods. We specifically designed bits for two flexible food items that differ in shape: ikura(salmon roe) and spaghetti. They represent the challenging categories of sticky, granular food and long, sticky, cluttered food, respectively. The gripper successfully picked up both spaghetti and ikura and demonstrated weight-specific dropping of these items with an accuracy over 80% and 95% respectively. The gripper system also exhibited quick switching between different bits, leading to the handling of a large range of food items."}

We propose neural multiple Lyapunov functions (NMLF), a unified framework that combines the theoretical guarantees of MLF with the computational efficiency of neural Lyapunov functions (NLF). Our approach leverages a set of tailored loss functions and a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) scheme to train neural networks that rigorously satisfy MLF conditions.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system."}

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic."}

Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the theory on practitioners and provides a dialogue-based hypothetical case study between a stakeholder and an engineer, demonstrating how the theory guides problem framing before designing any prescriptive artifacts."}

Embedded within a generator-discriminator framework, these mechanisms shift validation responsibilities from users to the system. Evaluations on three benchmark datasets, Spider, Bird, and GSM8K, demonstrate that both Q* and Feedback+ reduce error rates and task completion time.

The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game.

Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

Hybrid Factor Graphs give us a mathematical framework to model these types of problems, however existing approaches for solving them are based on approximations. In this work, we propose an efficient Hybrid Factor Graph framework alongwith a variable elimination algorithm to produce a hybrid Bayes network, which can then be used for exact Maximum A Posteriori estimation and marginalization over both sets of variables. Our approach first develops a novel hybrid Gaussian factor which can connect to both discrete and continuous variables, and a hybrid conditional which can represent multiple continuous hypotheses conditioned on the discrete variables. Using these representations, we derive the process of hybrid variable elimination under the Conditional Linear Gaussian scheme, giving us exact posteriors as hybrid Bayes network. To bound the number of discrete hypotheses, we use a tree-structured representation of the factors coupled with a simple pruning and probabilistic assignment scheme, which allows for tractable inference. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a SLAM dataset with ambiguous measurements, where discrete choices for the most likely measurement have to be made. Our demonstrated results showcase the accuracy, generality, and simplicity of our hybrid factor graph framework."}

Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating English counterfactuals and demonstrate multilingual proficiency. However, their effectiveness in generating multilingual counterfactuals remains unclear. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on multilingual counterfactuals. We first conduct automatic evaluations on both directly generated counterfactuals in the target languages and those derived via English translation across six languages. Although translation-based counterfactuals offer higher validity than their directly generated counterparts, they demand substantially more modifications and still fall short of matching the quality of the original English counterfactuals. Second, we find the patterns of edits applied to high-resource European-language counterfactuals to be remarkably similar, suggesting that cross-lingual perturbations follow common strategic principles. Third, we identify and categorize four main types of errors that consistently appear in the generated counterfactuals across languages. Finally, we reveal that multilingual counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) yields larger model performance improvements than cross-lingual CDA, especially for lower-resource languages.

We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets.

Multi-step deduction is enabled via Monte Carlo Tree Search and Evolutionary Proof Search, guided by learned value functions and semantic unification."}

However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers."}

As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook."}

In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan. Sensitivity analyses further show that the method scales well with the number of robots and that zone coverage behavior can be effectively controlled by adjusting priority weights."}

Investigating the Impact of Quantization on Self-Explanations", "comment": "In submission", "summary": "Quantization is widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet its effects on self-explanations (SEs) remain unexplored. SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique."}

We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines.

While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas.

ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance.

However, widely used depression datasets like DAIC-WOZ exhibit strong coupling between linguistic sentiment and diagnostic labels, encouraging models to learn semantic shortcuts. As a result, model robustness may be compromised in real-world scenarios, such as Camouflaged Depression, where individuals maintain socially positive or neutral language despite underlying depressive states. To mitigate this semantic bias, we propose DepFlow, a three-stage depression-conditioned text-to-speech framework. First, a Depression Acoustic Encoder learns speaker- and content-invariant depression embeddings through adversarial training, achieving effective disentanglement while preserving depression discriminability (ROC-AUC: 0.693). Second, a flow-matching TTS model with FiLM modulation injects these embeddings into synthesis, enabling control over depressive severity while preserving content and speaker identity. Third, a prototype-based severity mapping mechanism provides smooth and interpretable manipulation across the depression continuum. Using DepFlow, we construct a Camouflage Depression-oriented Augmentation (CDoA) dataset that pairs depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral content from a sentiment-stratified text bank, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches underrepresented in natural data. Evaluated across three depression detection architectures, CDoA improves macro-F1 by 9%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, consistently outperforming conventional augmentation strategies in depression Detection. Beyond enhancing robustness, DepFlow provides a controllable synthesis platform for conversational systems and simulation-based evaluation, where real clinical data remains limited by ethical and coverage constraints."}

LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning. We conclude that neural reasoning with explicit model construction is the most reliable among the three methodological categories of neural reasoning."}

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management."}

This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network."}

While bilingual data in pretraining corpora is widely believed to enable these abilities, details of its contributions remain unclear. We investigate this question by pretraining models from scratch under controlled conditions, comparing the standard web corpus with a monolingual-only version that removes all multilingual documents. Despite constituting only 2% of the corpus, removing bilingual data causes translation performance to drop 56% in BLEU, while behaviour on cross-lingual QA and general reasoning tasks remains stable, with training curves largely overlapping the baseline. To understand this asymmetry, we categorize bilingual data into parallel (14%), code-switching (72%), and miscellaneous documents (14%) based on the semantic relevance of content in different languages. We then conduct granular ablations by reintroducing parallel or code-switching data into the monolingual-only corpus. Our experiments reveal that parallel data almost fully restores translation performance (91% of the unfiltered baseline), whereas code-switching contributes minimally. Other cross-lingual tasks remain largely unaffected by either type. These findings reveal that translation critically depends on systematic token-level alignments from parallel data, whereas cross-lingual understanding and reasoning appear to be achievable even without bilingual data."}

Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation."}

Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level. The shifted-window transformer design proposed here beat all baselines by a wide margin and set new best marks in spike-based neuronal infection classification."}

By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin.

In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \\textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B).

Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks.

To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials.

We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of combining inertial constraints with observability-aware deformation activation, resulting in improved robustness under non-rigid environments."}

We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings."}

To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability.

Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed. We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study.

Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage.

Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks.

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

While TKGs and their generalization, hyper-relational temporal knowledge graphs (HTKGs), offer a straightforward structure to represent simple temporal relationships, they lack the expressive power to convey complex facts efficiently. One of the critical limitations of HTKGs is a lack of support for more than two primary entities in temporal facts, which commonly occur in real-world events. To address this limitation, in this work, we study a generalization of HTKGs, Hyper-Relational Temporal Knowledge Generalized Hypergraphs (HTKGHs). We first derive a formalization for HTKGHs, demonstrating their backward compatibility while supporting two complex types of facts commonly found in geopolitical incidents. Then, utilizing this formalization, we introduce the htkgh-polecat dataset, built upon the global event database POLECAT. Finally, we benchmark and analyze popular LLMs on the relation prediction task, providing insights into their adaptability and capabilities in complex forecasting scenarios."}

Under review", "summary": "Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization. In summary, ACCD provides a more accurate, efficient, and highly automated end-to-end solution for identifying coordinated behavior on social platforms, offering substantial practical value and promising potential for broad application."}

This can inflate the effective update budget and amplify drift along weakly constrained directions. We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law. Empirically, GRIT yields lower drift and a better updates-vs-retention frontier than strong PEFT-optimizer baselines (Orthogonal-LoRA, IA3, DoRA, Eff-FT, Shampoo)."}

To bridge this gap, building upon Evidential Deep Learning, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware framework termed DUAL, which dynamically disentangles prediction uncertainty into Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) and Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU). Specifically, we introduce EU as an indicator of sample scarcity to guide a reweighting strategy for hard-to-learn tail samples, while leveraging AU to quantify data ambiguity, employing an adaptive label smoothing mechanism to suppress the impact of noise. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework, surpassing strong baselines such as TGN and SADE.

Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic."}

A Methodology for Football with Broader Applications", "comment": "Submitted to Sci (MDPI) for peer review", "summary": "This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems. The paper concludes by outlining future directions toward real-world data integration, predictive simulation, and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence."}

Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios."}

This paper contrasts two broad approaches: social constructivist accounts associated with language games, and a mathematically oriented framework we call Semantic Field Theory. Building on earlier work by the author, we formalize the notions of lexical fields (Lexfelder) and linguistic fields (Lingofelder) as interacting structures in a continuous semantic space. We then analyze how core properties of transformer architectures-such as distributed representations, attention mechanisms, and geometric regularities in embedding spaces-relate to these concepts. We argue that the success of LLMs in capturing semantic regularities supports the view that language exhibits an underlying mathematical structure, while their persistent limitations in pragmatic reasoning and context sensitivity are consistent with the importance of social grounding emphasized in philosophical accounts of language use. On this basis, we suggest that mathematical structure and language games can be understood as complementary rather than competing perspectives. The resulting framework clarifies the scope and limits of purely statistical models of language and motivates new directions for theoretically informed AI architectures."}

Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight.

A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication.

We propose a robust NER approach leveraging Noise-Aware Training (NAT) with synthetically injected OCR errors, transfer learning, and multi-stage fine-tuning. Three complementary strategies, training on noisy, clean, and artificial data, are systematically compared. Our method is one of the first to recognize multiple entity types in VET documents. It is applied to German documents but transferable to arbitrary languages. Experimental results demonstrate that domain-specific and noise-aware fine-tuning substantially increases robustness and accuracy under noisy conditions. We provide publicly available code for reproducible noise-aware NER in domain-specific contexts."}

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities."}

Atomic sentence extraction, the task of decomposing complex sentences into simpler sentences that each express a single idea, improves performance in information retrieval, question answering, and automated reasoning systems. Previous work has formalized the \"split-and-rephrase\" task and established evaluation metrics, and machine learning approaches using large language models have improved extraction accuracy. However, these methods lack interpretability and provide limited insight into which linguistic structures cause extraction failures. Although some studies have explored dependency-based extraction of subject-verb-object triples and clauses, no principled analysis has examined which specific clause structures and dependencies lead to extraction difficulties. This study addresses this gap by analyzing how complex sentence structures, including relative clauses, adverbial clauses, coordination patterns, and passive constructions, affect the performance of rule-based atomic sentence extraction. Using the WikiSplit dataset, we implemented dependency-based extraction rules in spaCy, generated 100 gold=standard atomic sentence sets, and evaluated performance using ROUGE and BERTScore. The system achieved ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.6714, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.478, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.650, and BERTScore F1 = 0.5898, indicating moderate-to-high lexical, structural, and semantic alignment. Challenging structures included relative clauses, appositions, coordinated predicates, adverbial clauses, and passive constructions.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods."}

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%.

However, prevailing data augmentation strategies for videos remain largely perturbation-driven, often introducing uncontrolled variations that amplify non-discriminative factors, which finally weaken intra-class distributional structure and representation drift with inconsistent gains across temporal scales. To address these problems, we propose Representation-aware Mixing Augmentation (ReMA), a plug-and-play augmentation strategy that formulates mixing as a controlled replacement process to expand representations while preserving class-conditional stability. ReMA integrates two complementary mechanisms. Firstly, the Representation Alignment Mechanism (RAM) performs structured intra-class mixing under distributional alignment constraints, suppressing irrelevant intra-class drift while enhancing statistical reliability. Then, the Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) generates motion-aware spatiotemporal masks to localize perturbations, guiding them away from discrimination-sensitive regions and promoting temporal coherence. By jointly controlling how and where mixing is applied, ReMA improves representation robustness without additional supervision or trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on diverse video behavior benchmarks demonstrate that ReMA consistently enhances generalization and robustness across different spatiotemporal granularities."}

While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures."}

It employs the Depth-Aware Scanning (DAScan) to guide Mamba toward salient structures, promoting information flow along semantic coherence to construct stable states. Working in synergy with DAScan, the Depth-Synergized State-Space Model (DS-SSM) modulates the sensitivity of state activations by depth, suppressing the spread of ambiguous features that interfere with layer disentanglement.

The issue shows up when the capacity is tight or the data spans several languages. Such collapse makes it difficult for downstream tasks to build on the resulting representation. Existing compression methods focus on aligning model outputs at a superficial level but fail to preserve the underlying manifold structure. This mismatch often leads to semantic drift in the compact model, causing both task behavior and linguistic properties to deviate from the reference model.\n  To address those issues, we provide a new framework called Embedding Consistency Regulation (ECR). This framework first derives a set of semantic anchors from teacher embeddings (computed once offline). Then, the compact model learns to maintain consistent geometry around these anchors, without relying on matching logits or internal features. ECR adds only a small projection step at inference, without altering the decoding architecture or its runtime behavior.\n  In experiments on a 100K multilingual corpus, ECR consistently stabilizes training and preserves semantic structure across tasks and languages. It also produces a more compact and task-aligned representation space, enabling low-capacity models to learn cleaner manifolds than conventional baselines. ECR works without teacher outputs and is compatible with, but independent of, distillation. Taken together, our results show that ECR helps compact models better follow task requirements and makes them easier to deploy under strict efficiency or privacy limits."}

Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases.

To address this, we propose HarmoniAD, a frequency-guided dual-branch framework. Features are first extracted by the CLIP image encoder, then transformed into the frequency domain, and finally decoupled into high- and low-frequency paths for complementary modeling of structure and semantics. The high-frequency branch is equipped with a fine-grained structural attention module (FSAM) to enhance textures and edges for detecting small anomalies, while the low-frequency branch uses a global structural context module (GSCM) to capture long-range dependencies and preserve semantic consistency. Together, these branches balance fine detail and global semantics. HarmoniAD further adopts a multi-class joint training strategy, and experiments on MVTec-AD, VisA, and BTAD show state-of-the-art performance with both sensitivity and robustness."}

In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data."}

Existing studies typically resort to decoupled pipelines for geometry estimation and appearance synthesis, often hindering unified reconstruction and causing inconsistencies. This paper introduces \\textbf{JGA-LBD}, a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and appearance into a joint latent representation and formulates the generation process as bridge diffusion. Observing that directly integrating heterogeneous input conditions (e.g., depth maps, SMPL models) leads to substantial training difficulties, we unify all conditions into the 3D Gaussian representations, which can be further compressed into a unified latent space through a shared sparse variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the specialized form of bridge diffusion enables to start with a partial observation of the target latent code and solely focuses on inferring the missing components. Finally, a dedicated decoding module extracts the complete 3D human geometric structure and renders novel views from the inferred latent representation. Experiments demonstrate that JGA-LBD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both geometry fidelity and appearance quality, including challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

This work introduces InfoSynth, a novel framework for automatically generating and evaluating reasoning benchmarks guided by information-theoretic principles. We propose metrics based on KL-divergence and entropy to quantify benchmark novelty and diversity without relying on costly model evaluations. Building on this framework, we develop an end-to-end pipeline that synthesizes robust Python coding problems from seed datasets using genetic algorithms and iterative code feedback. Our method generates accurate test cases and solutions to new problems 97% of the time, and the synthesized benchmarks consistently exhibit higher novelty and diversity compared to their seed datasets. Moreover, our algorithm provides a method for controlling the novelty/diversity and difficulty of generated problems.

These Chinese-specific adversarial patterns create the safety evaluation gap that is not well captured by existing benchmarks focused on English. This gap is particularly concerning for lightweight models, which may be more vulnerable to such specific adversarial perturbations. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Chinese-Specific Safety Benchmark (CSSBench) that emphasizes these adversarial patterns and evaluates the safety of lightweight LLMs in Chinese. Our benchmark covers six domains that are common in real Chinese scenarios, including illegal activities and compliance, privacy leakage, health and medical misinformation, fraud and hate, adult content, and public and political safety, and organizes queries into multiple task types. We evaluate a set of popular lightweight LLMs and measure over-refusal behavior to assess safety-induced performance degradation. Our results show that the Chinese-specific adversarial pattern is a critical challenge for lightweight LLMs. This benchmark offers a comprehensive evaluation of LLM safety in Chinese, assisting robust deployments in practice."}

We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions.

Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs).

CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining.

Existing benchmarks primarily focus on tool usage or task completion, overlooking an agent's capacity to adhere to multi-step policies, navigate task dependencies, and remain robust to unpredictable user or environment behavior. In this work, we introduce JourneyBench, a benchmark designed to assess policy-aware agents in customer support. JourneyBench leverages graph representations to generate diverse, realistic support scenarios and proposes the User Journey Coverage Score, a novel metric to measure policy adherence. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs using two agent designs: a Static-Prompt Agent (SPA) and a Dynamic-Prompt Agent (DPA) that explicitly models policy control. Across 703 conversations in three domains, we show that DPA significantly boosts policy adherence, even allowing smaller models like GPT-4o-mini to outperform more capable ones like GPT-4o.

First, conversational context is paramount, with performance saturating rapidly -- 90\\% of the total gain achieved within just the most recent 10--30 preceding turns (depending on the label set). Second, hierarchical sentence representations help at utterance-level, but this benefit disappears once conversational context is provided, suggesting that context subsumes intra-utterance structure. Third, external affective lexicons (SenticNet) provide no gain, indicating that pre-trained encoders already capture necessary emotional semantics. With simple architectures using strictly causal context, we achieve 82.69\\% (4-way) and 67.07\\% (6-way) weighted F1, outperforming prior text-only methods including those using bidirectional context.\n  For linguistic analysis, we analyze 5,286 discourse marker occurrences and find a significant association between emotion and marker positioning ($p < .0001$).

To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks."}

Such errors are particularly problematic in deterministic automation workflows, where inputs are fixed and correctness is unambiguous. We introduce a simple and model-agnostic framework that provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for reducing hallucinations in this setting.\n  We formalize the notion of a specific task, defined by a fixed input and a deterministic correctness criterion, and show that issuing the same prompt in independent context windows yields an exponential reduction in the probability that all model outputs are incorrect. To identify a correct answer among repeated runs, we incorporate an LLM-as-a-judge and prove that the probability that the judged pipeline fails decays at a rate determined by the judge's true- and false-positive probabilities. When the judge is imperfect, we strengthen it through majority vote over independent judge calls, obtaining ensemble-level error rates that decrease exponentially in the number of votes. This yields an explicit bound on the probability that the pipeline selects a hallucinated answer.\n  Experiments on controlled extraction tasks with synthetic noisy judges match these predictions exactly: pipeline failure decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, and hallucination-selection decreases exponentially with the number of judges in the ensemble. Together, these results provide a lightweight, modular, and theoretically grounded method for driving hallucination probabilities arbitrarily low in fixed-input LLM workflows-without modifying model weights, decoding strategies, or prompt engineering."}

The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level.

In the second stage, a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting directly on voxel grids, reconstructing geometry and color while preserving observed regions. The model jointly predicts occupancy and color using a composite objective that combines occupancy reconstruction with masked color reconstruction and perceptual regularization.

However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions."}

While Softmax attention offers unbounded storage at prohibitive quadratic costs, linear variants provide efficiency but suffer from limited, fixed-size storage. We propose Fast-weight Product Key Memory (FwPKM), a novel architecture that resolves this tension by transforming the sparse Product Key Memory (PKM) from a static module into a dynamic, \"fast-weight\" episodic memory. Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets. Notably, in Needle in a Haystack evaluations, FwPKM generalizes to 128K-token contexts despite being trained on only 4K-token sequences."}

This can inflate the effective update budget and amplify drift along weakly constrained directions. We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law. Empirically, GRIT yields lower drift and a better updates-vs-retention frontier than strong PEFT-optimizer baselines (Orthogonal-LoRA, IA3, DoRA, Eff-FT, Shampoo)."}

This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called \"Twin Peaks\". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually.

When multiple output options are valid, the model's probability distribution is spread across them, which can misleadingly indicate low output quality. This issue is caused by two reasons: (1) LMs' final output activation is softmax, which does not allow multiple correct options to receive high probabilities simultaneuously and (2) LMs' training data is single, one-hot encoded references, indicating that there is only one correct option at each output step. We propose training a module for Quality Estimation on top of pre-trained LMs to address these limitations. The module, called Sigmoid Head, is an extra unembedding head with sigmoid activation to tackle the first limitation. To tackle the second limitation, during the negative sampling process to train the Sigmoid Head, we use a heuristic to avoid selecting potentially alternative correct tokens. Our Sigmoid Head is computationally efficient during training and inference. The probability from Sigmoid Head is notably better quality signal compared to the original softmax head. As the Sigmoid Head does not rely on human-annotated quality data, it is more robust to out-of-domain settings compared to supervised QE."}

We first conduct automatic evaluations on both directly generated counterfactuals in the target languages and those derived via English translation across six languages. Although translation-based counterfactuals offer higher validity than their directly generated counterparts, they demand substantially more modifications and still fall short of matching the quality of the original English counterfactuals. Second, we find the patterns of edits applied to high-resource European-language counterfactuals to be remarkably similar, suggesting that cross-lingual perturbations follow common strategic principles. Third, we identify and categorize four main types of errors that consistently appear in the generated counterfactuals across languages. Finally, we reveal that multilingual counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) yields larger model performance improvements than cross-lingual CDA, especially for lower-resource languages.

It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure.

Our training dataset consisted of approximately 104,000 and 22,000 de-identified pathology reports from the Newfoundland & Labrador Cancer Registry (NLCR) for Tier 1 (cancer vs. non-cancer) and Tier 2 (reportable vs. non-reportable) tasks, respectively. Both models were fine-tuned using complementary synoptic and diagnosis focused report section input pipelines. Across NLCR test sets, the adapted models maintained high performance, demonstrating transformers pretrained in one jurisdiction can be localized to another with modest fine-tuning. To improve sensitivity, we combined the two models using a conservative OR-ensemble achieving a Tier 1 recall of 0.99 and reduced missed cancers to 24, compared with 48 and 54 for the standalone models. For Tier 2, the ensemble achieved 0.99 recall and reduced missed reportable cancers to 33, compared with 54 and 46 for the individual models. These findings demonstrate that an ensemble combining complementary text representations substantially reduce missed cancers and improve error coverage in cancer-registry NLP.

First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords.

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable."}

Investigating the Impact of Quantization on Self-Explanations", "comment": "In submission", "summary": "Quantization is widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet its effects on self-explanations (SEs) remain unexplored. SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique."}

SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations.

By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior.

But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system."}

However, widely used depression datasets like DAIC-WOZ exhibit strong coupling between linguistic sentiment and diagnostic labels, encouraging models to learn semantic shortcuts. As a result, model robustness may be compromised in real-world scenarios, such as Camouflaged Depression, where individuals maintain socially positive or neutral language despite underlying depressive states. To mitigate this semantic bias, we propose DepFlow, a three-stage depression-conditioned text-to-speech framework. First, a Depression Acoustic Encoder learns speaker- and content-invariant depression embeddings through adversarial training, achieving effective disentanglement while preserving depression discriminability (ROC-AUC: 0.693). Second, a flow-matching TTS model with FiLM modulation injects these embeddings into synthesis, enabling control over depressive severity while preserving content and speaker identity. Third, a prototype-based severity mapping mechanism provides smooth and interpretable manipulation across the depression continuum. Using DepFlow, we construct a Camouflage Depression-oriented Augmentation (CDoA) dataset that pairs depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral content from a sentiment-stratified text bank, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches underrepresented in natural data. Evaluated across three depression detection architectures, CDoA improves macro-F1 by 9%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, consistently outperforming conventional augmentation strategies in depression Detection. Beyond enhancing robustness, DepFlow provides a controllable synthesis platform for conversational systems and simulation-based evaluation, where real clinical data remains limited by ethical and coverage constraints."}

In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features.

Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies."}

Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues. Other methods under different frameworks suffer from various problems like the huge gap between source image and target edited image as well as unreasonable intermediate point which can lead to low editability. To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively. In each iteration, Motion Prediction first predicts where the handle points should move, and then Motion Supervision drags them accordingly. We also propose to dynamically adjust the valid handle points to further improve the performance. Experiments on face and human datasets showcase the superiority over previous works."}

Prior work suggests that models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero undergo sudden mid-trace realizations that lead to accurate outputs, implying an intrinsic capacity for self-correction. Yet, it remains unclear whether such intrinsic shifts in reasoning strategy actually improve performance. Here, we study mid-reasoning shifts and instrument training runs to detect them. Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight. However, their effect varies with model uncertainty. Building on this finding, we show that artificially triggering extrinsic shifts under high entropy reliably improves accuracy.

However, the persistent challenge of LLM hallucination has emerged as a critical limitation, significantly compromising the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content. This challenge has garnered significant attention within the scientific community, prompting extensive research efforts in hallucination detection and mitigation strategies. Current methodological frameworks reveal a critical limitation: traditional uncertainty quantification approaches demonstrate effectiveness primarily within conventional question-answering paradigms, yet exhibit notable deficiencies when confronted with non-canonical or adversarial questioning strategies. This performance gap raises substantial concerns regarding the dependability of LLM responses in real-world applications requiring robust critical thinking capabilities.

We have meticulously constructed a set of trap questions contained with fake names. Based on this scenario, we innovatively propose a novel and robust uncertainty quantification method(RU). A series of experiments have been conducted to verify its effectiveness. The results show that the constructed set of trap questions performs excellently. Moreover, when compared with the baseline methods on four different models, our proposed method has demonstrated great performance, with an average increase of 0.1-0.2 in ROCAUC values compared to the best performing baseline method, providing new sights and methods for addressing the hallucination issue of LLMs."}

Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets."}

However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries.

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations.

To address these challenges, we propose and evaluate a novel approach that leverages Wikipedia and Wikidata as structured sources of weak supervision. By exploiting internal links within Wikipedia articles, we infer entity types based on their corresponding Wikidata entries, thereby generating initial annotations with minimal human intervention. Because such links are not uniformly reliable, we mitigate noise by employing and comparing several LLMs to identify and retain only high-quality labelled sentences.

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed."}

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity.

This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features.

Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection.

The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches.

This paper contrasts two broad approaches: social constructivist accounts associated with language games, and a mathematically oriented framework we call Semantic Field Theory. Building on earlier work by the author, we formalize the notions of lexical fields (Lexfelder) and linguistic fields (Lingofelder) as interacting structures in a continuous semantic space. We then analyze how core properties of transformer architectures-such as distributed representations, attention mechanisms, and geometric regularities in embedding spaces-relate to these concepts. We argue that the success of LLMs in capturing semantic regularities supports the view that language exhibits an underlying mathematical structure, while their persistent limitations in pragmatic reasoning and context sensitivity are consistent with the importance of social grounding emphasized in philosophical accounts of language use. On this basis, we suggest that mathematical structure and language games can be understood as complementary rather than competing perspectives. The resulting framework clarifies the scope and limits of purely statistical models of language and motivates new directions for theoretically informed AI architectures."}

Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

We provide a formal complexity analysis showing that M2S reduces training cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ for $n$-turn conversations. Empirically, on our training dataset (779 samples, avg. 10.6 turns), M2S requires only 169K tokens compared to 15.7M tokens for the multi-turn baseline -- a 93$\\times$ reduction. We evaluate Defensive M2S across three guardrail model families (LlamaGuard, Nemotron, Qwen3Guard) and three compression templates (hyphenize, numberize, pythonize) on SafeDialBench, a comprehensive multi-turn jailbreak benchmark. Our best configuration, Qwen3Guard with hyphenize compression, achieves 93.8% attack detection recall while reducing inference tokens by 94.6% (from 3,231 to 173 tokens per conversation).

Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer.

To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution. Based on MDI, we develop a Modality Dominance-Aware Cross-modal Learning (MDACL) framework that regulates cross-modal optimization.

Beyond their natural fit for domains where deep learning excels, we argue that the mere existence of human ``teachers\" supports the hypothesis that hierarchical structures are inherently available.

To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter.

It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble.

Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy.

An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates."}

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities."}

Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods."}

Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

The issue shows up when the capacity is tight or the data spans several languages. Such collapse makes it difficult for downstream tasks to build on the resulting representation. Existing compression methods focus on aligning model outputs at a superficial level but fail to preserve the underlying manifold structure. This mismatch often leads to semantic drift in the compact model, causing both task behavior and linguistic properties to deviate from the reference model.\n  To address those issues, we provide a new framework called Embedding Consistency Regulation (ECR). This framework first derives a set of semantic anchors from teacher embeddings (computed once offline). Then, the compact model learns to maintain consistent geometry around these anchors, without relying on matching logits or internal features. ECR adds only a small projection step at inference, without altering the decoding architecture or its runtime behavior.\n  In experiments on a 100K multilingual corpus, ECR consistently stabilizes training and preserves semantic structure across tasks and languages. It also produces a more compact and task-aligned representation space, enabling low-capacity models to learn cleaner manifolds than conventional baselines. ECR works without teacher outputs and is compatible with, but independent of, distillation. Taken together, our results show that ECR helps compact models better follow task requirements and makes them easier to deploy under strict efficiency or privacy limits."}

To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing.

Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks."}

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network."}

In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology."}

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions.

Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity.

We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction.

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm.

This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO.

This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications.

However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift.

Current work has focused on explicit span identification like Named Entity Recognition (NER), while more subjective span identification with LLMs in tasks like Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has been underexplored. In this paper, we fill this important gap by presenting an evaluation of the performance of various LLMs on text span identification in three popular tasks, namely sentiment analysis, offensive language identification, and claim verification. We explore several LLM strategies like instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain of thought. Our results indicate underlying relationships within text aid LLMs in identifying precise text spans."}

Unlike conventional methods relying on paired supervision, we leverage CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, mapping abundant visible-light PCB images into the infrared domain. This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection."}

This paper introduces an open radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled LAE framework that leverages seamless coordination between the disaggregated RAN architecture, open interfaces, and RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate closed-loop, AI-optimized, and mission-critical LAE operations. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes. We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs."}

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network."}

Investigating the Impact of Quantization on Self-Explanations", "comment": "In submission", "summary": "Quantization is widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet its effects on self-explanations (SEs) remain unexplored. SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique."}

While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures."}

While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring."}

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline."}

We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data).

We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of combining inertial constraints with observability-aware deformation activation, resulting in improved robustness under non-rigid environments."}
