However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources."}

This allows for vulnerabilities in non-English contexts, especially with low-resource languages. We introduce a novel application of knowledge distillation (KD) in the context of multilingual jailbreak prevention, examining its efficacy. We distill the refusal behaviors of a proprietary teacher model (OpenAI o1-mini) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into three open-source student models: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-2B-IT, and Qwen3-8B, using ~28,000 multilingual jailbreak prompts from XSafety via black-box response-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluation on the MultiJail benchmark reveals a counterintuitive behavior: standard fine-tuning on the teacher's ``safe'' refusal data inadvertently increases Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) for all student models, up to 16.6 percentage points. Our experiments reveal a divergent generalization to unseen languages during distillation, with varying outcomes depending on the base model. By removing a primary source of safety degradation, nuanced `boundary' refusals, we mitigate or even reverse safety declines in student models, although reductions in reasoning performance (GSM8K) persist. Overall, our exploratory study highlights the challenges and potential of KD as a technique for multilingual safety alignment, offering a foundation for future research in this direction."}

However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. Our study provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs."}

However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as \"state drift\" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation."}

While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\\textbf{m}ated opt\\textbf{i}mization modeli\\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training. MIND is based on our key observation of the unique localizable patterns in error propagation of optimization modelings, that is, modeling errors may remain localized to specific semantic segments and do not propagate throughout the entire solution. Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \\textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \\textbf{F}ine-Tuning \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement.

We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\\geq80\\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

While effective in complex scenarios, they lack the verification guarantees found in classical guidance policies. Their black-box nature creates significant concerns regarding trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in safety-critical spaceflight applications. This work addresses this gap by developing a method to assess the safety of a trained neural network feedback controller via automatic domain splitting and polynomial bounding. The methodology involves embedding the trained neural network into the system's dynamical equations, rendering the closed-loop system autonomous. The system flow is then approximated by high-order Taylor polynomials, which are subsequently manipulated to construct polynomial maps that project state uncertainties onto an event manifold. Automatic domain splitting ensures the polynomials are accurate over their relevant subdomains, whilst also allowing an extensive state-space to be analysed efficiently. Utilising polynomial bounding techniques, the resulting event values may be rigorously constrained and analysed within individual subdomains, thereby establishing bounds on the range of possible closed-loop outcomes from using such neural network controllers and supporting safety assessment and informed operational decision-making in real-world missions."}

We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach."}

From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning.

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms."}

Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction.

The required posterior probability density function of the game's state is derived from the available noisy measurements using an interacting multiple model particle filter. When the resulting optimal decision turns out to be nonunique, this feature is harnessed to appropriately shape the trajectory of the pursuer so as to enhance its estimator's performance. In addition, certain properties of the particle-based computation of the Bayesian cost are exploited to render the algorithm amenable to real-time implementation.

For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models."}

To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments.

Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail. Spectra tracks the spike subspace via cached, warm started power iteration and applies low rank spectral shaping with negligible overhead and substantially reduced optimizer state memory. On LLaMA3 8B trained on 50B tokens, Spectra reaches the same target loss 30% faster than AdamW, reduces per step end to end overhead by 0.7%, cuts optimizer state memory by 49.25%, and improves average downstream accuracy by 1.62%. Compared to Muon, Spectra is 5.1x faster in optimizer processing time, achieves a lower final loss, and improves average accuracy by 0.66%."}

We introduce the chemo-hydrodynamic transceiver, a unified model for catalytic Janus particles in which an external optical control simultaneously drives molecular emission and active self-propulsion. Unlike common abstractions that decouple mobility and communication, we derive a stochastic channel model that captures their physicochemical coupling and shows that actuation-induced distance jitter can dominate the received-signal variance, yielding a fundamental trade-off: stronger actuation increases emission but can sharply reduce reliability through motion-induced fading. Numerical results reveal a unimodal reliability profile with a critical actuation level beyond which the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, and an optimal control level that scales approximately linearly with link distance. Compared with Brownian-mobility baselines, the model exposes a pronounced estimation gap: neglecting active motility noise can underestimate the bit error probability by orders of magnitude. These findings provide physical-layer guidelines for mobility-aware IoBNT protocol design and closed-loop control of nanorobotic swarms."}

We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \\r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

However, these GenAI applications impose immense computational burdens on edge hardware, leaving strictly limited resources for fundamental security tasks like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal protection. Furthermore, training robust classifiers for such devices is hindered by the scarcity of real-world interference data. To address the dual challenges of data scarcity and the extreme efficiency required by the GenAI era, this paper proposes a novel framework named GAC-KAN. First, we adopt a physics-guided simulation approach to synthesize a large-scale, high-fidelity jamming dataset, mitigating the data bottleneck. Second, to reconcile high accuracy with the stringent resource constraints of GenAI-native chips, we design a Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone. This backbone combines Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACB) and Ghost modules to extract rich spectral-temporal features with minimal redundancy. Replacing the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decision head, we introduce a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which employs learnable spline activation functions to achieve superior non-linear mapping capabilities with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that GAC-KAN achieves an overall accuracy of 98.0\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Significantly, the model contains only 0.13 million parameter--approximately 660 times fewer than Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines. This extreme lightweight characteristic makes GAC-KAN an ideal \"always-on\" security companion, ensuring GNSS reliability without contending for the computational resources required by primary GenAI tasks."}

Due to the inherent difference in short-circuit capacity contributions of synchronous generators and inverters, the short-circuit ratio is not a one-size-fit-all metric to assess the system strength. Following the distinct dynamic behavior of the IBR in small- and large-signal disturbance, the system strength is separated accordingly. To address the large-signal system strength assessment, a control type-dependent metric, Power Margin Ratio (PMR), is proposed in this paper. PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power that can be injected to the system without causing any instability and the nominal power of the IBR. It can be obtained via power flow calculation with a modified algorithm. The theoretical foundation of PMR is established from the viewpoint of dynamical systems. PMR is identical to SCR for the single-plant-infinite-bus system, while presents advancement for multi-infeed power systems. Comprehensive case studies and discussions have validated that PMR reveals the large-signal system strength from a static perspective."}

The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other."}

Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot."}

Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm.

Notably, we first prove that for directed signed matrix-weighted networks, every eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacians has positive real part under certain conditions. This key finding ensures the global asymptotic convergence of systems states to the null spaces of signed matrix-weighted Laplacians, providing a foundational tool for analyzing dynamics on rooted signed matrix-weighted networks. To achieve non-trivial consensus, we propose a systematic approach involving the strategic selection of informed agents, careful design of external signals, and precise determination of coupling terms. Crucially, we derive the lower bounds of the coupling coefficients. Our consensus algorithm operates under milder connectivity conditions, and does not impose restrictions on whether the network is structurally balanced or unbalanced. Moreover, the non-trivial consensus state can be preset arbitrarily as needed. We also carry out the above analysis for undirected networks, with more relaxed conditions on the coupling coefficients comparing to the directed case. This paper further studies non-trivial consensus with switching topologies, and propose the necessary condition for the convergence of switching networks. The work in this paper demonstrates that groups with both cooperative and antagonistic multi-dimensional interactions can achieve consensus, which was previously deemed exclusive to fully cooperative groups."}

Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments.

However, we have found that existing methods typically employ a strategy of embedding each time step as an independent token. This paradigm introduces a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences, the root cause of which is that independent token embedding destroys a crucial structure within the sequence - what we term as multi-offset temporal correlation. This refers to the fine-grained dependencies embedded within the sequence that span across different time steps, which is especially prevalent in regular Web data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a new perspective on time series embedding. We provide an upper bound on the approximate reconstruction performance of token embedding, which guides our design of a concise yet effective Multi-Offset Time Embedding method to mitigate the performance degradation caused by standard token embedding. Furthermore, our MOTE can be integrated into various existing models and serve as a universal building block. Based on this paradigm, we further design a novel forecasting architecture named Time-TK. This architecture first utilizes a Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn and represent specific temporal patterns among multiple offset sub-sequences. Subsequently, it employs an efficient Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to effectively capture the complex dependencies between these sub-sequences, achieving global information integration.

However, the foundational \"ground truth\" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience."}

The security of the system, therefore, may be overestimated. To address this gap, we introduce a market model with a social-welfare-based day-ahead market clearing mechanism. The security implications are analyzed via Cascades, a cascading outage analysis framework. We apply this framework to the IEEE-118 bus system with three independent control zones. The results show that market dispatch leads to an increase in demand not served of up to 80% higher than OPF, highlighting a security overestimation.

For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PRIME-Bench, the largest algorithmic reasoning benchmark to date, comprising 86 tasks across 12 categories with 51,600 instances.

The largest improvements occur on tasks requiring sustained state tracking, with Turing machine simulation improving from 9% to 92% and long division from 16% to 94%.

Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep."}

Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency."}

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations."}

However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications."}

This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance."}

Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations."}

Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles.

To address this, we first compare the transient responses of an ideal voltage source and a GFM to show that an idealistic GFM maintains a (nearly) constant voltage across the filter capacitor, rather than at the inverter switches. Then we propose a systematic method to quantify the effective impedance of a GFM from its black-box model using frequency-domain admittance plots. Using standard PSCAD GFM models developed by NREL, we demonstrate that the GFM's equivalent impedance model captures the sub-transient response and static voltage stability limit reasonably accurately."}

To support this formulation, we construct Re$^3$Align, the first large-scale dataset of aligned review--response--revision triplets, where revisions provide signals of author expertise and intent. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show the benefits of author input and evaluation-guided refinement, the impact of input design on response quality, and trade-offs between controllability and quality. We make our dataset, generation and evaluation tools publicly available."}

While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property."}

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access.

However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as \"state drift\" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation."}

This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\\eps \\to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets.

As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions.

Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models."}

To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively.

Recent approaches introduce recurrent memory to extend context beyond the current window, yet these often face a fundamental trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability. To address this, we introduce Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture grounded in the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. Elastic Memory treats historical sequence as samples from continuous signals, applying optimal online compression to encode them into a fixed-size memory state. For retrieval, we propose a flexible \\textit{polynomial sampling} mechanism that reconstructs a history summary from this compressed state. Elastic Memory consistently outperformed baselines on long-context (32k+) datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes, even when Melodi had 30% more parameters. When scaling model size, Elastic Memory stayed ahead of all baselines and was significantly faster than Melodi at 4x size. Furthermore, its decoupled design allows for injecting inductive biases at test-time to boost performance."}

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate."}

We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples.

Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects."}

Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling."}

Particularly, our study shows that multi-disciplinary learning is substantially more variable than single-discipline training and distills four consistent empirical laws: (1) Balance-then-Diversity: low-resource disciplines degrade performance unless mitigated via diversity-aware upsampling; (2) Merge-then-Align: restoring instruction-following ability is critical for cross-discipline synergy; (3) Optimize-then-Scale: parameter scaling offers limited gains without prior design optimization; and (4) Share-then-Specialize: asymmetric LoRA-MoE yields robust gains with minimal trainable parameters via shared low-rank projection.

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy."}

In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization.

While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics.

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors.

We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability.

We analyze current evaluation practices, highlighting sources of instability and limited reproducibility, and we catalog existing benchmarks while critically examining their linguistic coverage and English-centric biases. Finally, we discuss emerging safety concerns, including use of code-mixing as a mechanism for bypassing model safeguards, and identify open research challenges."}

While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios."}

Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity."}

However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%."}

In this paper, we propose MetaMem, a novel framework that augments memory systems with a self-evolving meta-memory, aiming to teach LLMs how to effectively utilize memorized knowledge. During meta-memory optimization, MetaMem iteratively distills transferable knowledge utilization experiences across different tasks by self-reflecting on reasoning processes and performing actions to update the current meta-memory state. The accumulated meta-memory units serve as explicit knowledge utilization experiences, guiding the LLM to systematically identify and integrate critical evidence from scattered memory fragments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaMem, which significantly outperforms strong baselines by over 3.6%.

While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a \"blind spot\" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act."}

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process."}

Our results reveal a threefold complexity spectrum, with Pydantic AI and Agno requiring the least implementation overhead.

Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency.

However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks.

Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness."}

In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints."}

Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer.

Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment."}

This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance."}

As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks."}

We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to \"one size fits all\" designs."}

Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation."}

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias."}

In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration."}

Consequently, researchers, especially those outside CS, lack clear guidance on using ASG systems to yield high-quality surveys compliant with specific discipline standards. To bridge this gap, we introduce SurveyLens, the first discipline-aware benchmark evaluating ASG methods across diverse research disciplines. We construct SurveyLens-1k, a curated dataset of 1,000 high-quality human-written surveys spanning 10 disciplines.

We conduct extensive experiments by evaluating 11 state-of-the-art ASG methods on SurveyLens, including Vanilla LLMs, ASG systems, and Deep Research agents.

In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization."}

By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata.

In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior."}

Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain."}

We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance).

The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce \"loop\" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce \"shimmer\" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002).

A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box\" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight.

In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch.

However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines."}

Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation.

In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections. Results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches, particularly OOD.

This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items.

In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains."}

We evaluated the simulator's effectiveness in identifying errors in an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection. Results: We generated 500 conversations between the patient simulator and the AI decision aid across systematic combinations of five linguistic and three behavioral profiles. Human annotators assessed 1,787 medical concepts across 100 conversations, achieving high agreement (F1=0.94, \\k{appa}=0.73), and the LLM judge achieved comparable agreement with human annotators (F1=0.94, \\k{appa}=0.78; paired bootstrap p=0.21). The simulator revealed a monotonic degradation in AI decision aid performance across the health literacy spectrum: rank-one concept retrieval accuracy increased from 47.9% for limited health literacy to 69.1% for functional and 81.6% for proficient."}

Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis."}

We identify the essential heads via ablation on a synthetic retrieval task, producing a hybrid with sparse, non-uniform attention placement. We show that preserving **just 2% of attention heads recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks** (10 heads in a 1B model), requiring far fewer heads than hybrids that retain at least 25%. We further find that large recurrent states often compensate for missing retrieval: once retrieval is handled by these heads, the SSM backbone can be simplified with limited loss, even with an $8\\times$ reduction in state dimension. By reducing both the attention cache and the SSM state, the resulting hybrid is $5$--$6\\times$ more memory-efficient than comparable hybrids, closing the Transformer--SSM gap at a fraction of the memory cost."}

To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation."}

Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge.

In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information.

We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold."}

In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers.

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x."}

WSBD intelligently focuses computational resources by identifying and temporarily freezing less influential parameters based on a gradient-derived importance score. This approach significantly reduces the number of forward passes required per training step and helps navigate the optimization landscape more effectively. Unlike pruning or layer-wise freezing, WSBD maintains full expressive capacity while adapting throughout training.

When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails."}

We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating. Empirically, LoopFormer demonstrates robust performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks even under aggressive compute constraints, while scaling gracefully with additional budget.

To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling.

On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit."}

However, existing evaluation benchmarks provide minimal coverage of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To address this gap, we introduce ADRD-Bench, the first ADRD-specific benchmark dataset designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. ADRD-Bench has two components: 1) ADRD Unified QA, a synthesis of 1,352 questions consolidated from seven established medical benchmarks, providing a unified assessment of clinical knowledge; and 2) ADRD Caregiving QA, a novel set of 149 questions derived from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program, a widely used, evidence-based brain health management program. Guided by a program with national expertise in comprehensive ADRD care, this new set was designed to mitigate the lack of practical caregiving context in existing benchmarks. We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03).

While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans."}

Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive \"feature sharpness\" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable \"feature explosion\" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments.

To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains.

Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency.

In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability."}

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning.

Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning.

Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing. To accelerate convergence, we introduce an expert-merging warm-up strategy, where experts exchange knowledge early in training, to rapidly establish foundational capabilities.

Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints.

While Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) with explicit feature interactions have long dominated this domain, recent advances in generative recommenders have shown promising results in content recommendation. However, adapting these transformer-based architectures to ads CTR prediction still presents unique challenges, including handling post-scoring contextual signals, maintaining offline-online consistency, and scaling to industrial workloads. We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders.

This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples."}

Consequently, agents easily fall into \"Tunnel Vision,\" where the forced interpretation of early noisy retrievals leads to irreversible error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose SIGHT, a framework that enhances search-based reasoning through Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching. SIGHT distills search results into high-fidelity evidence via SES and calculates an Information Gain score to pinpoint pivotal states where observations maximally reduce uncertainty. This score guides Dynamic Prompting Interventions - including de-duplication, reflection, or adaptive branching - to spawn new branches with SES. Finally, by integrating SES and correctness rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization, SIGHT internalizes robust exploration strategies without external verifiers. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SIGHT significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex reasoning scenarios, using fewer search steps."}

If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$.

We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87).

Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence."}

AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety."}

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x."}

A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence.

Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort. Crucially, we prove that under mild conditions, this mechanism enables agents to reach arbitrarily high levels solely through genuine improvement efforts."}

We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods."}

Efficient organization of this knowledge in user memory is essential for enabling personalized applications. However, current research on memory writing, management, and reading using large language models (LLMs) faces challenges in filtering irrelevant information and in dealing with rising computational costs. Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge."}

Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios.

This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge.

However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery.

A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture."}

Assessing these movements is important for helping clinicians prescribe appropriate physical therapy. However, it can be difficult to monitor patients' movements remotely outside the clinic. High-fidelity data from motion capture sensors can be used to classify different movements, but these sensors are costly and impractical for use in free-living environments. Motion Tape (MT), a new fabric-based wearable sensor, addresses these issues by being low cost and portable. Despite these advantages, novelty and variability in sensor stability make the MT dataset small scale and inherent to noise. In this work, we propose the Motion-Tape Augmentation Inference Model (MT-AIM), a deep learning classification pipeline trained on MT data. In order to address the challenges of limited sample size and noise present within the MT dataset, MT-AIM leverages conditional generative models to generate synthetic MT data of a desired movement, as well as predicting joint kinematics as additional features. This combination of synthetic data generation and feature augmentation enables MT-AIM to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying lower back movements, bridging the gap between physiological sensing and movement analysis."}

Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.\n  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters.

This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG).

However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA).

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks."}

The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem."}

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate."}

In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical.

The CMAB component prunes low-quality actions, yielding compact high-scoring subspaces for exploration. Restricting GFNs to these compact high-scoring subspaces accelerates the discovery of high-value candidates, while the exploration of different subspaces ensures that diversity is not sacrificed.

We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances.

Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification.

Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime.

However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications.

As existing GFlowNets freely explore in state space, they encounter significant convergence challenges when scaling to large state spaces. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes to restrict the exploration of actor. A planner is introduced to partition the entire state space into overlapping partial state spaces. Given their limited size, these partial state spaces allow the actor to efficiently identify subregions with higher rewards. A heuristic strategy is introduced to switch partial regions thus preventing the actor from wasting time exploring fully explored or low-reward partial regions. By iteratively exploring these partial state spaces, the actor learns to converge towards the high-reward subregions within the entire state space. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that \\modelname converges faster than existing works on large state spaces. Furthermore, \\modelname not only generates candidates with higher rewards but also significantly improves their diversity."}

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric."}

We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace."}

We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code.

We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently.

Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel."}

By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints."}

This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors."}

We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\\% over the best baseline.

Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks."}

A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks."}

By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation.

These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility."}

However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency.

We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting."}

To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes.

To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents.

Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length.

We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

In this work, we introduce two proactive anomaly detection frameworks: the Forward Forecasting Model (FFM) and the Backward Reconstruction Model (BRM). Both models leverage a hybrid architecture combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformer encoders to model directional temporal dynamics. FFM forecasts future sequences to anticipate disruptions, while BRM reconstructs recent history from future context to uncover early precursors.

To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency.

To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed.

Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry.

This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems."}

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively.

Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available."}

In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms."}

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively."}

Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment."}

In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate.

Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context.

Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \\emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \\emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \\texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \\emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \\texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper."}

To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format.

Despite these advantages, MDMs face a fundamental limitation: once tokens are unmasked, they remain fixed, leading to error accumulation and ultimately degrading sample quality. We address this by proposing a framework that trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction. By reusing outputs from the MDM denoising network as inputs for corrector training, we train a model to recover from potential mistakes. During generation we apply additional corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones in order to change decoded tokens and improve outputs. We name our training and sampling method Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) for its unique ability to iteratively refine an entire sequence, including already generated tokens. We conduct extensive experimental validation across multiple conditional and unconditional tasks, demonstrating that ProSeCo yields better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling to further increase sample quality beyond standard MDMs (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks)."}

We argue this scalar framing is fundamentally limited: when training requires multiple distinct capabilities, a monolithic scorer cannot maximize useful signals for all of them simultaneously. Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks. The learned rater signals are near orthogonal, confirming that the decomposition captures genuinely independent quality dimensions and explaining why it outperforms both unfiltered training and monolithic learned filtering."}

We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning."}

In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations. These results expose a gap between pretraining based evaluation and downstream performance, and emphasize the need for model selection and evaluation strategies that explicitly account for downstream task characteristics."}

High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations.

The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values.

To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios.

ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods."}

These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks.

Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.\n  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm.

While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors."}

To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning.

Our proof proceeds in three steps: (1) we show that UMAP's stochastic optimisation with negative sampling is a contrastive learning objective on the similarity graph; (2) we invoke the result of HaoChen et al. [8], establishing that contrastive learning on a similarity graph is equivalent to spectral clustering; and (3) we verify that UMAP's spectral initialisation computes the exact linear solution to this spectral problem.

This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation.

We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.\n  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs).\n  Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class.\n  These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns."}

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications."}

Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM."}

Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance.

A Nobel laureate's contribution receives the same weight as an unverified submission. We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment.

Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices."}

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X.

In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales.

For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.\n  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's \"bitter lesson\" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier.

While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models."}

To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing.

In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement."}

In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations.

Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as \"state drift\" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation."}

We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers.

While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\\textbf{m}ated opt\\textbf{i}mization modeli\\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training.

However, these GenAI applications impose immense computational burdens on edge hardware, leaving strictly limited resources for fundamental security tasks like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal protection. Furthermore, training robust classifiers for such devices is hindered by the scarcity of real-world interference data. To address the dual challenges of data scarcity and the extreme efficiency required by the GenAI era, this paper proposes a novel framework named GAC-KAN. First, we adopt a physics-guided simulation approach to synthesize a large-scale, high-fidelity jamming dataset, mitigating the data bottleneck. Second, to reconcile high accuracy with the stringent resource constraints of GenAI-native chips, we design a Multi-Scale Ghost-ACB-Coordinate (MS-GAC) backbone. This backbone combines Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACB) and Ghost modules to extract rich spectral-temporal features with minimal redundancy. Replacing the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decision head, we introduce a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which employs learnable spline activation functions to achieve superior non-linear mapping capabilities with significantly fewer parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that GAC-KAN achieves an overall accuracy of 98.0\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Significantly, the model contains only 0.13 million parameter--approximately 660 times fewer than Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines.

We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints.

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\\eps \\to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets.

We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning.

While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case.

We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule."}

As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks."}

In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models."}

Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs."}

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias."}

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning.

We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories. This trajectory-guided, reward-driven mechanism enables online adaptation without additional rollouts, directly aligning exploration with policy improvement. On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, TAMPO outperforms baselines using fixed or heuristic temperatures, establishing temperature as an effective learnable meta-policy for adaptive exploration in LLM reinforcement learning.

However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources."}

Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models.

We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications."}

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances"}

Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access.

To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets.

However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment."}

While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems.

We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive \"feature sharpness\" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable \"feature explosion\" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

We propose a structured latent-variable formulation that requires only observations of solution realizations and learns the underlying randomly forced dynamics. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics. The latent dynamics and stochastic forcing are jointly inferred through variational learning, allowing recovery of stochastic structure without explicit observation or simulation of noise during training. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance under comparable modeling assumptions across bounded and unbounded one-dimensional spatial domains."}

We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks."}

In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism. Empirical results show that CIR exhibits strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, even being competitive or surpassing existing strong baseline methods."}

For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models."}

To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation."}

On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime.

Ensuring fairness in this task is thus essential. While many fairness-aware methods manipulate graph structures to mitigate prediction disparities, the topological biases inherent to social graph structures remain poorly understood and are often reduced to homophily alone. This undermines the generalization potential of fairness interventions and limits their applicability across diverse network topologies. In this work, we propose a novel benchmarking framework for fair LP, centered on the structural biases of the underlying graphs. We begin by reviewing and formalizing a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. In parallel, we introduce a flexible graph generation method that simultaneously ensures fidelity to real-world graph patterns and enables controlled variation across a wide spectrum of structural biases. We apply this framework to evaluate both classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases. Our results provide a fine-grained empirical analysis of the interactions between predictive fairness and structural biases. This new perspective reveals the sensitivity of fairness interventions to beyond-homophily biases and underscores the need for structurally grounded fairness evaluations in graph learning."}

The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other."}

This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification. We evaluate ISCT on HalfCheetah, Walker2d, Hopper, and Maze2d, including settings with delayed rewards and downgraded datasets.

Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations."}

However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods."}

However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases."}

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate."}

Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models."}

Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines."}

The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations.

We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents.

Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data. Together, our framework quantifies the extent to which LLMs behave like GP learners and provides tools for steering their inductive biases for continuous function learning tasks."}

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms."}

We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive.

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS.

Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP).

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\\max\\{0,Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it."}

However, we have found that existing methods typically employ a strategy of embedding each time step as an independent token. This paradigm introduces a fundamental information bottleneck when processing long sequences, the root cause of which is that independent token embedding destroys a crucial structure within the sequence - what we term as multi-offset temporal correlation. This refers to the fine-grained dependencies embedded within the sequence that span across different time steps, which is especially prevalent in regular Web data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a new perspective on time series embedding. We provide an upper bound on the approximate reconstruction performance of token embedding, which guides our design of a concise yet effective Multi-Offset Time Embedding method to mitigate the performance degradation caused by standard token embedding. Furthermore, our MOTE can be integrated into various existing models and serve as a universal building block. Based on this paradigm, we further design a novel forecasting architecture named Time-TK. This architecture first utilizes a Multi-Offset Interactive KAN to learn and represent specific temporal patterns among multiple offset sub-sequences. Subsequently, it employs an efficient Multi-Offset Temporal Interaction mechanism to effectively capture the complex dependencies between these sub-sequences, achieving global information integration. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmark datasets, covering domains such as traffic flow and BTC/USDT throughput, demonstrate that Time-TK significantly outperforms all baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy."}

In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph."}

In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead.

We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning."}

Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality."}

Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%.

However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models."}

While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness.

For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers.

The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\\eps \\to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics).

We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse \"vulnerability games\", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow \"tricks\" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even \"distilled\" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

However, FL systems are usually deployed in heterogeneous scenarios, where nodes differ in both data distributions and participation frequencies, which undermines the FL performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.\n  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios."}

Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity."}

Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/G-OPD", "summary": "On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD."}

The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes.

The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead."}

The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image.

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications."}

While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs."}

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = Ω_ε(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_ε(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Turán's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias."}

Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM."}

This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d.

An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications."}

Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance).

First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks."}

The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines."}

The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \\r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

Here, we explore how expressivity in LRNNs can be increased via richer state mixing across time and channels while maintaining competitive efficiency. Specifically, we introduce two structured LRNN architectures: (i) Higher-order Linear Recurrent Units (H-LRU), which generalize first-order recurrence to higher order, mixing multiple past states, and (ii) Block-Diagonal LRUs (BD-LRU), which enable dense intra-block channel mixing. Per-channel (H-LRU) or per-row (BD-LRU) L1-normalization of selective gates stabilizes training and allows for scaling window/block sizes. A parallel-scan implementation of the proposed architectures keeps the throughput competitive with diagonal LRNNs for moderate orders (H-LRU) and block sizes (BD-LRU). In synthetic sequence modeling tasks, the performance of BD-LRU matches or exceeds those of linear SSMs (Mamba), low-rank LRNNs (DeltaNet) and LSTM baselines, while H-LRU is found to be the most parameter-efficient in compression task. In both synthetic sequence modeling and language modeling, our results indicate that the structure of state mixing rather than width alone shapes expressivity of LRNNs, offering a practical route to closing the efficiency-expressivity gap in linear sequence models."}

In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule."}

We introduce ProtoMech, a framework for discovering computational circuits in pLMs using cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry. Applied to the pLM ESM2, ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of the original performance on protein family classification and function prediction tasks. ProtoMech then identifies compressed circuits that use <1% of the latent space while retaining up to 79% of model accuracy, revealing correspondence with structural and functional motifs, including binding, signaling, and stability. Steering along these circuits enables high-fitness protein design, surpassing baseline methods in more than 70% of cases.

We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce \"loop\" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce \"shimmer\" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls.

This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads."}

Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability. This method provides a practical route toward more reliable and clinically trustworthy deep learning models, particularly valuable in data-limited healthcare settings."}

This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species.

However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines."}

Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

We identify the essential heads via ablation on a synthetic retrieval task, producing a hybrid with sparse, non-uniform attention placement. We show that preserving **just 2% of attention heads recovers over 95% of teacher performance on retrieval-heavy tasks** (10 heads in a 1B model), requiring far fewer heads than hybrids that retain at least 25%. We further find that large recurrent states often compensate for missing retrieval: once retrieval is handled by these heads, the SSM backbone can be simplified with limited loss, even with an $8\\times$ reduction in state dimension. By reducing both the attention cache and the SSM state, the resulting hybrid is $5$--$6\\times$ more memory-efficient than comparable hybrids, closing the Transformer--SSM gap at a fraction of the memory cost."}

We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process.

The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods.

Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning.

Our work is inspired by the following open question: \"Are $Q^\\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?\"\n  We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.\n  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases. Finally, we provide the first analysis for CQL under $Q^\\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness beyond the tabular case."}

This rigidity creates a two-fold failure mode: (i) overemphasizing low-probability targets can amplify gradients on noisy supervision and disrupt robust priors, and (ii) uniform weighting provides weak sharpening when the model is already confident. Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance."}

However, the basic setting considered by these methods is simplified compared to real-world experimental setups, where experiments often generate a wealth of useful information. We introduce a new setting where an experiment generates high-dimensional auxiliary information $h(x)$ along with the performance measure $f(x)$; moreover, a history of previously solved tasks from the same task family is available for accelerating optimization. A key challenge of our setting is learning how to represent and utilize $h(x)$ for efficiently solving new optimization tasks beyond the task history. We develop a novel approach for this setting based on a neural model which predicts $f(x)$ for unseen designs given a few-shot context containing observations of $h(x)$. We evaluate our method on two challenging domains, robotic hardware design and neural network hyperparameter tuning, and introduce a novel design problem and large-scale benchmark for the former. On both domains, our method utilizes auxiliary feedback effectively to achieve more accurate few-shot prediction and faster optimization of design tasks, significantly outperforming several methods for multi-task optimization."}

Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts.

At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.\n  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead."}

In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans.

We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse \"vulnerability games\", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow \"tricks\" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even \"distilled\" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates.

Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/G-OPD", "summary": "On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD."}

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution."}

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster."}

To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories.

We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting.

In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations.

Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. Experiments across vision (ViT on CIFAR/ImageNet), autoregressive generation (MNIST/CIFAR-10), and large language models (Llama/Qwen) demonstrate consistent gains with substantially reduced computation, highlighting bounded-confidence dynamics as a scalable and effective inductive bias for attention."}

Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers."}

This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems."}

We investigate these effects through Identity Preference Optimization, a widely used preference alignment framework, and show that proper instance-dependent sampling can yield stronger ranking guarantees, while skewed on-policy sampling can induce excessive concentration under structured preferences. We then analyze iterative alignment dynamics in which the learned policy feeds back into future sampling and reference policies, reflecting a common practice of model-generated preference data. We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods.

Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/."}

We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\\approx 0.05$).

The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update.

The benchmark pairs 35 PDF documents with JSON Schemas and human-annotated gold labels across economically valuable domains, yielding 12,867 evaluatable fields spanning schema complexities from tens to hundreds of fields. The evaluation framework treats the schema as an executable specification: each field declares its scoring metric. Baseline evaluations reveal that frontier models (GPT-5/5.2, Gemini-3 Flash/Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet) remain unreliable on realistic schemas. Performance degrades sharply with schema breadth, culminating in 0% valid output on a 369-field financial reporting schema across all tested models. We release ExtractBench at https://github.com/ContextualAI/extract-bench."}

In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis."}

Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning."}

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x."}

However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series."}

Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors. Both Fun-DDPS and the joint-state baseline (Fun-DPS) achieve Jensen-Shannon divergence less than 0.06 against the ground truth.

We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform.

We introduce ANML (Attribution-Native Machine Learning), a framework that weights training samples by four quality factors: gradient-based consistency (q), verification status (v), contributor reputation (r), and temporal relevance (T). By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution. Across 5 datasets (178-32,561 samples), ANML achieves 33-72% error reduction over gradient-only baselines. Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment. When per-sample detection fails against subtle corruption, contributor-level attribution provides 1.3-5.3x greater improvement than sample-level methods, with the advantage growing as corruption becomes harder to detect."}

Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments. We find different patterns in RMSNorm-based architectures, suggesting that the dissociation depends on architectural choices.

Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline. Further analysis indicates that TabSieve concentrates more attention on the selected evidence, which improves robustness to noisy context."}

Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models."}

Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design.

This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision.

While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints."}

However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances"}

While effective in complex scenarios, they lack the verification guarantees found in classical guidance policies. Their black-box nature creates significant concerns regarding trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in safety-critical spaceflight applications. This work addresses this gap by developing a method to assess the safety of a trained neural network feedback controller via automatic domain splitting and polynomial bounding. The methodology involves embedding the trained neural network into the system's dynamical equations, rendering the closed-loop system autonomous. The system flow is then approximated by high-order Taylor polynomials, which are subsequently manipulated to construct polynomial maps that project state uncertainties onto an event manifold. Automatic domain splitting ensures the polynomials are accurate over their relevant subdomains, whilst also allowing an extensive state-space to be analysed efficiently. Utilising polynomial bounding techniques, the resulting event values may be rigorously constrained and analysed within individual subdomains, thereby establishing bounds on the range of possible closed-loop outcomes from using such neural network controllers and supporting safety assessment and informed operational decision-making in real-world missions."}

Submitted to TMLR", "summary": "Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess safety risk through breadth-oriented evaluation across diverse tasks. However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment."}

Recent \"Thinking-with-Images\" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents.

We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce \"loop\" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce \"shimmer\" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002).

However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines."}

Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive.

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($Δ_θ$) merely beats the reference margin ($Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($Δ_θ<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $Δ_θ-Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $Δ_θ-\\max\\{0,Δ_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost. By conditionally debiasing the pessimistic reference signal, HyPO mitigates premature satisfaction; empirically, across preference alignment, HyPO improves inference-aligned metrics and achieves higher pairwise win rates. Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it."}

HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications."}

We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available."}

In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration."}

To tackle the above issue, this paper proposes PMFL, a performance-enhanced model-contrastive federated learning framework using historical training information. Specifically, on the node side, we design a novel model-contrastive term into the node optimization objective by incorporating historical local models to capture stable contrastive points, thereby improving the consistency of model updates in heterogeneous data distributions.\n  On the server side, we utilize the cumulative participation count of each node to adaptively adjust its aggregation weight, thereby correcting the bias in the global objective caused by different node participation frequencies. Furthermore, the updated global model incorporates historical global models to reduce its fluctuations in performance between adjacent rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMFL achieves superior performance compared with existing FL methods in heterogeneous scenarios."}

We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy.

While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including scientific documents, news publishers, and review ratings, demonstrate that MaT-LoRA achieves superior temporal generalization performance with practical scalability for LLMs."}

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency.

Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model.

While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints."}

This representation is periodicity-native, admits simple algebraic actions of space-group symmetries, and naturally supports variable atomic multiplicities during generation, addressing a common limitation of particle-based approaches. Using only nine Fourier basis functions per spatial dimension, our approach reconstructs unit cells containing up to 108 atoms per chemical species.

We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute.

In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition.

Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.\n  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\\star$ is unknown.

However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency.

Equal contribution: Yordan Yordanov and Matteo Forasassi. 39 pages, 25 figures, 22 tables", "summary": "While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.\n  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead."}

Recent \"Thinking-with-Images\" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when \"Thinking-with-Images\" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD."}

In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data.

In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability.

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning.

This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions.

Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment."}

We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\\approx 0.05$).

We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks."}

However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices."}

In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines."}

LLMs are increasingly deployed to automate this extraction, making accuracy and reliability paramount. However, progress is bottlenecked by two gaps. First, no end-to-end benchmark evaluates PDF-to-JSON extraction under enterprise-scale schema breadth. Second, no principled methodology captures the semantics of nested extraction, where fields demand different notions of correctness (exact match for identifiers, tolerance for quantities, semantic equivalence for names), arrays require alignment, and omission must be distinguished from hallucination. We address both gaps with ExtractBench, an open-source benchmark and evaluation framework for PDF-to-JSON structured extraction. The benchmark pairs 35 PDF documents with JSON Schemas and human-annotated gold labels across economically valuable domains, yielding 12,867 evaluatable fields spanning schema complexities from tens to hundreds of fields. The evaluation framework treats the schema as an executable specification: each field declares its scoring metric. Baseline evaluations reveal that frontier models (GPT-5/5.2, Gemini-3 Flash/Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet) remain unreliable on realistic schemas. Performance degrades sharply with schema breadth, culminating in 0% valid output on a 369-field financial reporting schema across all tested models. We release ExtractBench at https://github.com/ContextualAI/extract-bench."}

However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D."}

The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.g., in the form of lecturer support - in order to enable optimal learning conditions."}

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090."}

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the \"intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate."}
