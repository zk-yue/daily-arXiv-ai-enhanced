Second paper in TAAC research series. Code and data at https://github.com/micoverde/taac-llm-compression", "summary": "In \"Compress or Route?\" (Johnson, 2026), we found that code generation tolerates aggressive prompt compression (r >= 0.6) while chain-of-thought reasoning degrades gradually. That study was limited to HumanEval (164 problems), left the \"perplexity paradox\" mechanism unvalidated, and provided no adaptive algorithm. This paper addresses all three gaps. First, we validate across six code benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, HumanEval+, MultiPL-E) and four reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, ARC-Challenge, MMLU-STEM), confirming the compression threshold generalizes across languages and difficulties. Second, we conduct the first per-token perplexity analysis (n=723 tokens), revealing a \"perplexity paradox\": code syntax tokens are preserved (high perplexity) while numerical values in math problems are pruned despite being task-critical (low perplexity). Signature injection recovers +34 percentage points in pass rate (5.3% to 39.3%; Cohen's h=0.890). Third, we propose TAAC (Task-Aware Adaptive Compression), achieving 22% cost reduction with 96% quality preservation, outperforming fixed-ratio compression by 7%. MBPP validation (n=1,800 trials) confirms systematic variation: 3.6% at r=0.3 to 54.6% at r=1.0."}

However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\\textbf{Ta}$ble $\\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \\leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding."}

Our qualitative and quantitative analyses identify common trends in the field and highlight key research gaps as well as the absence of unified evaluation practice for KD methods in MT.

In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers."}

The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods.

To be specific, a variable neighborhood descent (VND) heuristic is proposed for the general routing phase, while a second-order cone programming (SOCP) procedure is applied in the close-enough routing phase. These two phases are performed in an iterative fashion under the framework of an adaptive iterated local search (AILS) algorithm until the predefined termination criteria are satisfied. Extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed AILS-VND-SOCP algorithm and the superiority of disk neighborhoods."}

The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems."}

Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations. These results show that using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ADS safety evaluation."}

We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks."}

A Benchmark of Uncertainty Metrics for LLM-Based Automatic Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future."}

In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time.

We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure."}

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving.

To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics."}

Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2.

To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization."}

In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher."}

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios."}

We demonstrate lateral excitation of symmetric lamb (S0) modes in X-cut BTO membranes, in contrast to prior thickness-defined ferroelectric resonators. Devices are designed using finite-element simulations and fabricated with laterally patterned electrodes that enable overtone coupling to multiple resonant modes. Under applied DC bias, ferroelectric domains align, allowing electrical excitation, frequency tuning, and quality-factor enhancement of acoustic modes. Resonances near 300 MHz and 700 MHz exhibit electromechanical coupling up to 8% and bias-dependent frequency tuning, with a distinct transition in behavior near 20 V.

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons.

We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories.

The architecture integrates a sparse symbolic backbone to capture dominant model skeletons with a neural residual branch that compensates for complex nonlinear control logic. Meanwhile, a Jacobian-regularized physics-informed training mechanism is introduced to enforce multi-scale consistency including large/small-scale behaviors. Furthermore, by performing symbolic regression on the neural residual branch, PISML achieves a tractable mapping from black-box data to explicit control equations. Experimental results on a high-fidelity Hardware-in-the-Loop platform demonstrate the framework's superior performance. It not only achieves high-resolution identification by reducing error by over 340 times compared to baselines but also realizes the compression of heavy neural networks into compact explicit forms. This restores analytical tractability for rigorous stability analysis and reduces computational complexity by orders of magnitude. It also provides a unified pathway to convert structurally inaccessible devices into explicit mathematical models, enabling stability analysis of power systems with unknown inverter governing equations."}

This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training.

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts."}

However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics."}

However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

The proposed method operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) an MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) a geometric projection module that utilizes depth data to localize targets in 3D space; and (3) a geometric planner that generates collision-free trajectories. This mechanism enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost. By eliminating the need for continuous inference, Fly0 reduces computational overhead and improves system stability.

Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency.

The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols."}

Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity.

We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas.

The proposed method is structured using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the additional active power loading capacity of the network and each individual bus is determined using an iterative approach. This analysis quantifies the network's additional active loadability limits and identifies buses with high active power loading capacity, which are considered candidate nodes for the placement of DG units. Subsequently, in the second stage, the optimal locations and sizes of DG units are determined using the Monte Carlo method, with the objectives of minimizing voltage deviation and reducing active power losses in the network. The methodology is validated on the standard IEEE 33-bus RDN to determine the optimal locations and sizes of DG units. The results demonstrate that the optimal allocation of one, two, and three DG units, achieved from proposed method, reduces network active power losses by 50.37%, 58.62%, and 65.16%, respectively, and also significantly enhances the voltage profile across all buses. When the obtained results are compared with the results of several existing studies, it is found that the proposed method allows for larger DG capacities and maintains better voltage profiles throughout the RDN."}

To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm.

This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement).

The system IMTD's tracking accuracy and reliability are compared to a motion capture system (MoCap), assessing its ability to capture both angular and translational motions of surgical instruments. The study then focuses on key performance parameters including precision, fluidity, speed, and overall motion efficiency. The results highlight the system's effectiveness in tracking surgical gestures, providing valuable insights into its potential as a tool for training and performance evaluation in minimally invasive surgery. Additionally, IMTD's low cost and integrated design allow for easy integration and implementation in training rooms, offering a practical and accessible solution for general use.

Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors."}

We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG.

Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms."}

The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods.

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.\n  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.\n  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.\n  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise."}

An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal."}

To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity."}

In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data.

Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution.

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering."}

We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%).

Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations.

Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source."}

Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained."}

Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG. Finally, we introduce BTReport-BraTS, a companion dataset that augments BraTS imaging with synthetically generated radiology reports produced with BTReport.

However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power."}

Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.\n  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.\n  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization.

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies."}

Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets."}

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding."}

Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail."}

Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates.

We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric.

Copyright notice may change", "summary": "Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction."}

Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations.

We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions."}

Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies."}

We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference.

This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\\textbf{Ta}$ble $\\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows.

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video.

Uncertainty-aware planners have recently been developed to account for upstream perception and prediction uncertainty. However, such planners may be sensitive to prediction uncertainty miscalibration, the magnitude of which has not yet been characterized. Towards this end, we perform a detailed analysis on the impact that perceptual uncertainty propagation and calibration has on perception-based motion planning. We do so by comparing two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying levels of uncertainty propagation on the recently-released nuPlan planning benchmark. We study the impact of upstream uncertainty calibration using closed-loop evaluation on the nuPlan challenge scenarios. We find that the method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation demonstrates superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios."}

Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation."}

In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring."}

Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss.

Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations.

This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities.

In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets."}

We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision.

However, the inherent discrete representation of text in existing frameworks often results in a loss of semantic integrity, leading to retrieval deviations. Inspired by the human episodic memory mechanism, we propose CogitoRAG, a RAG framework that simulates human cognitive memory processes. The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support. Experimental results across five mainstream QA benchmarks and multi-task generation on GraphBench demonstrate that CogitoRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, showcasing superior capabilities in complex knowledge integration and reasoning."}

Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance."}

Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs."}

We address these gaps by proposing a token-based foundation model (TOFU) for MMKGR, which exhibits strong generalization across different MMKGs. TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens. TOFU then employs a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms, aiming to process these tokens and obtain transferable features for MMKGR.

Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios."}

The Expert Agent optimizes multi-turn goal preferences at the dialogue-trajectory level, while the Customer Service Agent generates responses strictly aligned with the selected strategy. We evaluate GOPO on public benchmarks and e-commerce customer service datasets, and introduce Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE), a sequence-level metric derived from real e-commerce interaction data.

Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations.

We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms.

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior."}

First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems."}

Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations."}

However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods."}

An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal."}

In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU."}

Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach.

In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency.

Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR).

We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data.

We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs."}

To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring."}

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies."}

To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed."}

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities."}

This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks.

Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack."}

Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical prototype during crawling and walking gaits, achieving high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories. These results demonstrate a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots."}

Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs."}

Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer superior reasoning, deploying them as low-level controllers leads to high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding. To address these limitations, we propose Fly0, a framework that decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning. The proposed method operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) an MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) a geometric projection module that utilizes depth data to localize targets in 3D space; and (3) a geometric planner that generates collision-free trajectories. This mechanism enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost. By eliminating the need for continuous inference, Fly0 reduces computational overhead and improves system stability. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that Fly0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the Success Rate by over 20\\% and reducing Navigation Error (NE) by approximately 50\\% in unstructured environments.

Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness."}

Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation."}

Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area.

We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy.

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios."}

First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified.

The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy.

However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep."}

The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems."}

To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities.

We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment."}

In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot.

The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support.

To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics."}

Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects."}

However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior."}

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained."}

We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior."}

To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction.

While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning."}

One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory."}

It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation."}

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs."}

Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models."}

However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\\times$ faster encoding speeds.

Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual."}

LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology."}

Copyright notice may change", "summary": "Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction."}

The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions."}

In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements.

In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention."}

To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$.

An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power."}

To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory.

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss."}

We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data."}

We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide.

They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback."}

We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions."}

These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data.

Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss).

Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies."}

Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention."}

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains.

In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach.

In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling."}

In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed.

This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks.

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities."}

Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design.

The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding."}

This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."}

Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."}

We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities."}

REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs."}

Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs.

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."}

Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation."}

We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases.

Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models."}

These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting.

We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool."}

This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.\n  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems."}

While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa.

Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2. Conclusions: Mirror provided evidence traceability: 74.2% of outputs cited at least one guideline-tier source, with 100% citation accuracy on manual verification. Curated evidence with explicit provenance can outperform unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty clinical reasoning and supports auditability for clinical deployment."}

Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \\(λ\\) ranging from one to five.

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation."}

The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile.

We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts."}

Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness."}

While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences."}

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing."}

Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach.

We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\\top A x + b^\\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries)."}

While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."}

Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates.

The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible."}

We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock.

Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance. Notably, on AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, our approach achieves accuracies of 96.67% and 72.53%, respectively, substantially outperforming homogeneous role-play baselines, which score 80% and 65.93%."}

Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers."}

They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback."}

While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding."}

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning."}

First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points. Importantly, both are functions of nearest neighbor relationships between points, not distances, making them applicable to various distance functions including inner product."}

In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines.

Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline.

Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise."}

In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system.

Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection.

They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods.

We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."}

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city.

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."}

Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained."}

To enhance the diversity of LLM outputs while ensuring quality, we propose the Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO). QEMPO aims to maximize the output entropy of the policy while ensuring output quality. By adding different constraints to QEMPO, we obtain different policies.

In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers."}

Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline."}

Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure."}

In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering.

We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts.

Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed \"extract then store,\" involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the \"store then on-demand extract\" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them."}

These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual."}

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering."}

Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning."}

We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."}

LLM-as-a-jury for Comparative Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."}

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail."}

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained."}
