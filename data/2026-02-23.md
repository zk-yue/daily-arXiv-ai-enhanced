Abstract: Despite recent advancements, video captioning models still face significant limitations in accurately describing fine-grained motion details and suffer from severe hallucination issues. These challenges become particularly prominent when generating captions for motion-centric videos, where precise depiction of intricate movements and limb dynamics is crucial yet often neglected. To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models. By integrating MoPE into the GRPO post-training framework, we effectively mitigate hallucination problems, significantly improving the reliability of motion-centric video captioning models.

Abstract: Hands play a central role in daily life, yet modeling natural hand motions remains underexplored. Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to "in-the-wild" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling. Code, data and models will be released.

Abstract: It is a critical task to evalaute HER2 expression level accurately for breast cancer evaluation and targeted treatment therapy selection. However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks. Extensive experiments on the public BCI dataset demonstrate that LGD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods while enabling efficient inference using single-modality H&E inputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have opened new opportunities for zero-shot text-guided segmentation of remote sensing imagery. However, most existing approaches still rely on additional trainable components, limiting their generalisation and practical applicability. In this work, we investigate to what extent text-based remote sensing segmentation can be achieved without additional training, by relying solely on existing foundation models. We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates contrastive and generative VLMs with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enabling a fully training-free or lightweight LoRA-tuned pipeline. Our contrastive approach employs CLIP as mask selector for SAM's grid-based proposals, achieving state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) in a completely zero-shot setting. In parallel, our generative approach enables reasoning and referring segmentation by generating click prompts for SAM using GPT-5 in a zero-shot setting and a LoRA-tuned Qwen-VL model, with the latter yielding the best results. Extensive experiments across 19 remote sensing benchmarks, including open-vocabulary, referring, and reasoning-based tasks, demonstrate the strong capabilities of our approach. Code will be released at https://github.com/josesosajs/trainfree-rs-segmentation.

Abstract: Existing online video segmentation models typically combine a per-frame segmenter with complex specialized tracking modules. While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

Abstract: Query performance prediction (QPP) is an important and actively studied information retrieval task, having various applications, such as query reformulation, query expansion, and retrieval system selection, among many others. The task has been primarily studied in the context of text and image retrieval, whereas QPP for content-based video retrieval (CBVR) remains largely underexplored. To this end, we propose the first benchmark for video query performance prediction (VQPP), comprising two text-to-video retrieval datasets and two CBVR systems, respectively. VQPP contains a total of 56K text queries and 51K videos, and comes with official training, validation and test splits, fostering direct comparisons and reproducible results. We explore multiple pre-retrieval and post-retrieval performance predictors, creating a representative benchmark for future exploration of QPP in the video domain. Our results show that pre-retrieval predictors obtain competitive performance, enabling applications before performing the retrieval step. We also demonstrate the applicability of VQPP by employing the best performing pre-retrieval predictor as reward model for training a large language model (LLM) on the query reformulation task via direct preference optimization (DPO). We release our benchmark and code at https://github.com/AdrianLutu/VQPP.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological analysis of the gesture-recognition approach proposed by Liu and Szirányi, with a particular focus on the validity of their evaluation protocol. We show that the reported near-perfect accuracy metrics result from a frame-level random train-test split that inevitably mixes samples from the same subjects across both sets, causing severe data leakage. By examining the published confusion matrix, learning curves, and dataset construction, we demonstrate that the evaluation does not measure generalization to unseen individuals. Our findings underscore the importance of subject-independent data partitioning in vision-based gesture-recognition research, especially for applications - such as UAV-human interaction - that require reliable recognition of gestures performed by previously unseen people.

Abstract: With recent advancements in video backbone architectures, combined with the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), the analysis of long-form videos spanning tens of minutes has become both feasible and increasingly prevalent. However, the inherently redundant nature of video sequences poses significant challenges for contemporary state-of-the-art models. These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks. These results underscore the versatility and efficacy of our approach, particularly in managing the complexities of prolonged video sequences.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress across a wide range of visual question answering benchmarks, spanning visual reasoning, document understanding, and multimodal dialogue. These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining. These insights pave the way for enhancing fine-grained visual understanding and vision-centric capabilities in VLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion-based approaches have recently demonstrated strong performance for single-image novel view synthesis by conditioning generative models on geometry inferred from monocular depth estimation. However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term "Zero-token" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.
  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following robotic manipulation, but they are typically pretrained on 2D data and lack 3D spatial understanding. An effective approach is representation alignment, where a strong vision foundation model is used to guide a 2D VLA model. However, existing methods usually apply supervision at only a single layer, failing to fully exploit the rich information distributed across depth; meanwhile, naïve multi-layer alignment can cause gradient interference. We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models. The code and model weights can be found at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/ROCKET-VLA.

Abstract: Existing full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods achieve high-precision evaluation by analysing feature differences between reference and distorted images. However, their performance is constrained by the quality of the reference image, which limits real-world applications where ideal reference sources are unavailable. Notably, the human visual system has the ability to accumulate visual memory, allowing image quality assessment on the basis of long-term memory storage. Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images. When reference images are available, MQAF obtains reference-guided quality scores by adaptively weighting reference information and comparing the distorted image with stored distortion patterns in the memory bank. When the reference image is absent, the framework relies on distortion patterns in the memory bank to infer image quality, enabling no-reference quality assessment (NR-IQA). The experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets while adapting to both no-reference and full-reference tasks.

Abstract: Underwater Object Tracking (UOT) is crucial for efficient marine robotics, large scale ecological monitoring, and ocean exploration; however, progress has been hindered by the scarcity of large, multimodal, and diverse datasets. Existing benchmarks remain small and RGB only, limiting robustness under severe color distortion, turbidity, and low visibility conditions. We introduce MUOT_3M, the first pseudo multimodal UOT benchmark comprising 3 million frames from 3,030 videos (27.8h) annotated with 32 tracking attributes, 677 fine grained classes, and synchronized RGB, estimated enhanced RGB, estimated depth, and language modalities validated by a marine biologist. Building upon MUOT_3M, we propose MUTrack, a SAM-based multimodal to unimodal tracker featuring visual geometric alignment, vision language fusion, and four level knowledge distillation that transfers multimodal knowledge into a unimodal student model. Extensive evaluations across five UOT benchmarks demonstrate that MUTrack achieves up to 8.40% higher AUC and 7.80% higher precision than the strongest SOTA baselines while running at 24 FPS. MUOT_3M and MUTrack establish a new foundation for scalable, multimodally trained yet practically deployable underwater tracking.

Abstract: Previous studies on visual customization primarily rely on the objective alignment between various control signals (e.g., language, layout and canny) and the edited images, which largely ignore the subjective emotional contents, and more importantly lack general-purpose foundation models for affective visual customization. With this in mind, this paper proposes an LLM-centric Affective Visual Customization (L-AVC) task, which focuses on generating images within modifying their subjective emotions via Multimodal LLM. Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images. Specifically, an Efficient Inter-emotion Converting (EIC) module is tailored to make the LLM efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics before and after editing, followed by a Precise Exter-emotion Retaining (PER) module to precisely retain the emotion-agnostic contents. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on our constructed L-AVC dataset demonstrate the great advantage of the proposed EPEM approach to the L-AVC task over several state-of-the-art baselines. This justifies the importance of emotion information for L-AVC and the effectiveness of EPEM in efficiently and precisely manipulating such information.

Abstract: In the literature, prior research on Security-oriented Video Understanding (SVU) has predominantly focused on detecting and localize the threats (e.g., shootings, robberies) in videos, while largely lacking the effective capability to generate and evaluate the threat causes. Motivated by these gaps, this paper introduces a new chat paradigm SVU task, i.e., In-depth Security-oriented Video Understanding (DeepSVU), which aims to not only identify and locate the threats but also attribute and evaluate the causes threatening segments. Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach. Specifically, UPRM incorporates two key components: the Unified Physical-world Enhanced MoE (UPE) Block and the Physical-world Trade-off Regularizer (PTR), to address the above two challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments conduct on our DeepSVU instructions datasets (i.e., UCF-C instructions and CUVA instructions) demonstrate that UPRM outperforms several advanced Video-LLMs as well as non-VLM approaches. Such information.These justify the importance of the coarse-to-fine physical-world information in the DeepSVU task and demonstrate the effectiveness of our UPRM in capturing such information.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as backbones to map images and instructions to actions, demonstrating remarkable potential for generalizable robotic manipulation. To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as "key-value memory", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead. Notably, UAOR eliminates the need for additional observation cues or modules, making it a versatile and practical plug-in for existing VLA pipelines.

Abstract: Training-free control over editing intensity is a critical requirement for diffusion-based image editing models built on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(δ_k, δ_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark (700 images, 10 editing categories) demonstrate that DCAG consistently outperforms Key-only guidance across all fidelity metrics, with the most significant improvements observed in localized editing tasks such as object deletion (4.9% LPIPS reduction) and object addition (3.2% LPIPS reduction).

Abstract: Few-Shot Action Recognition (FSAR) is a challenging task that requires recognizing novel action categories with a few labeled videos. Recent works typically apply semantically coarse category names as auxiliary contexts to guide the learning of discriminative visual features. However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns. Experimental results show DiST achieves state-of-the-art results on five standard FSAR datasets.

Abstract: City-scale person re-identification across distributed cameras must handle severe appearance changes from viewpoint, occlusion, and domain shift while complying with data protection rules that prevent sharing raw imagery. We introduce CityGuard, a topology-aware transformer for privacy-preserving identity retrieval in decentralized surveillance. The framework integrates three components. A dispersion-adaptive metric learner adjusts instance-level margins according to feature spread, increasing intra-class compactness. Spatially conditioned attention injects coarse geometry, such as GPS or deployment floor plans, into graph-based self-attention to enable projectively consistent cross-view alignment using only coarse geometric priors without requiring survey-grade calibration. Differentially private embedding maps are coupled with compact approximate indexes to support secure and cost-efficient deployment. Together these designs produce descriptors robust to viewpoint variation, occlusion, and domain shifts, and they enable a tunable balance between privacy and utility under rigorous differential-privacy accounting. Experiments on Market-1501 and additional public benchmarks, complemented by database-scale retrieval studies, show consistent gains in retrieval precision and query throughput over strong baselines, confirming the practicality of the framework for privacy-critical urban identity matching.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. While two-stage frameworks leveraging discrete motion representations have advanced T2M research, they often neglect cross-sequence temporal consistency, i.e., the shared temporal structures present across different instances of the same action. This leads to semantic misalignments and physically implausible motions. To address this limitation, we propose TCA-T2M, a framework for temporal consistency-aware T2M generation. Our approach introduces a temporal consistency-aware spatial VQ-VAE (TCaS-VQ-VAE) for cross-sequence temporal alignment, coupled with a masked motion transformer for text-conditioned motion generation. Additionally, a kinematic constraint block mitigates discretization artifacts to ensure physical plausibility. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks demonstrate that TCA-T2M achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of temporal consistency in robust and coherent T2M generation.

Abstract: 3D CT analysis spans a continuum from low-level perception to high-level clinical understanding. Existing 3D-oriented analysis methods adopt either isolated task-specific modeling or task-agnostic end-to-end paradigms to produce one-hop outputs, impeding the systematic accumulation of perceptual evidence for downstream reasoning. In parallel, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit improved visual perception and can integrate visual and textual information effectively, yet their predominantly 2D-oriented designs fundamentally limit their ability to perceive and analyze volumetric medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose 3DMedAgent, a unified agent that enables 2D MLLMs to perform general 3D CT analysis without 3D-specific fine-tuning. 3DMedAgent coordinates heterogeneous visual and textual tools through a flexible MLLM agent, progressively decomposing complex 3D analysis into tractable subtasks that transition from global to regional views, from 3D volumes to informative 2D slices, and from visual evidence to structured textual representations. Central to this design, 3DMedAgent maintains a long-term structured memory that aggregates intermediate tool outputs and supports query-adaptive, evidence-driven multi-step reasoning. We further introduce the DeepChestVQA benchmark for evaluating unified perception-to-understanding capabilities in 3D thoracic imaging. Experiments across over 40 tasks demonstrate that 3DMedAgent consistently outperforms general, medical, and 3D-specific MLLMs, highlighting a scalable path toward general-purpose 3D clinical assistants.Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}.

Abstract: Dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic maps are central to autonomous driving, yet current multi-camera methods depend on costly, inconsistently annotated BEV ground truth. We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds. The results demonstrate that differentiable reprojection plus camera perspective pseudo labels yields transferable BEV features and a scalable path toward reduced-label autonomous perception.

Abstract: Despite having hundreds of millions of speakers, handwritten Devanagari text remains severely underrepresented in publicly available benchmark datasets. Existing resources are limited in scale, focus primarily on isolated characters or short words, and lack controlled lexical content and writer level diversity, which restricts their utility for modern data driven handwriting analysis. As a result, they fail to capture the continuous, fused, and structurally complex nature of Devanagari handwriting, where characters are connected through a shared shirorekha (horizontal headline) and exhibit rich ligature formations. We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors. The dataset is designed as a parallel stylistic corpus, in which all writers transcribe the same fixed set of six traditional Hindi dohas (couplets). This controlled design enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation independent of linguistic content, and supports tasks such as handwriting recognition, writer identification, style analysis, and generative modeling. The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking. Baseline experiments demonstrate clear quality separation and strong generalization to unseen writers, highlighting the dataset's reliability and practical value. DohaScript is intended to serve as a standardized and reproducible benchmark for advancing research on continuous handwritten Devanagari text in low resource script settings.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a widely adopted backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation, yet their iterative denoising process incurs high computational costs. Existing training-free acceleration methods rely on feature caching and reuse under the assumption of temporal stability. However, reusing features for multiple steps may lead to latent drift and visual degradation. We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to $5.54\times$ latency reduction across various DiT-based image and video generation models, while incurring negligible quality degradation.

Abstract: Existing Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress by being trained on massive-scale datasets, typically under the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, in real-world scenarios, it is often impractical to expect that all data processed by an AI system satisfy this assumption. Furthermore, failure to appropriately handle out-of-distribution (OOD) objects may introduce safety risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving or medical assistance). Unfortunately, current research has not yet provided valid benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of VLMs in response to OOD data. Therefore, we propose OODBench, a predominantly automated method with minimal human verification, for constructing new benchmarks and evaluating the ability of VLMs to process OOD data. OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common. In addition, we propose a reliable automated assessment metric that employs a Basic-to-Advanced Progression of prompted questions to assess the impact of OOD data on questions of varying difficulty more fully. Lastly, we summarize substantial findings and insights to facilitate future research in the acquisition and evaluation of OOD data.

Abstract: Vision Transformers, ViTs, have emerged as a powerful alternative to convolutional neural networks, CNNs, in a variety of image-based tasks. While CNNs have previously been evaluated for their ability to perform graphical perception tasks, which are essential for interpreting visualizations, the perceptual capabilities of ViTs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the performance of ViTs in elementary visual judgment tasks inspired by the foundational studies of Cleveland and McGill, which quantified the accuracy of human perception across different visual encodings. Inspired by their study, we benchmark ViTs against CNNs and human participants in a series of controlled graphical perception tasks. Our results reveal that, although ViTs demonstrate strong performance in general vision tasks, their alignment with human-like graphical perception in the visualization domain is limited. This study highlights key perceptual gaps and points to important considerations for the application of ViTs in visualization systems and graphical perceptual modeling.

Abstract: Short-video platforms now host vast multimodal ads whose deceptive visuals, speech and subtitles demand finer-grained, policy-driven moderation than community safety filters. We present BLM-Guard, a content-audit framework for commercial ads that fuses Chain-of-Thought reasoning with rule-based policy principles and a critic-guided reward. A rule-driven ICoT data-synthesis pipeline jump-starts training by generating structured scene descriptions, reasoning chains and labels, cutting annotation costs. Reinforcement learning then refines the model using a composite reward balancing causal coherence with policy adherence. A multitask architecture models intra-modal manipulations (e.g., exaggerated imagery) and cross-modal mismatches (e.g., subtitle-speech drift), boosting robustness. Experiments on real short-video ads show BLM-Guard surpasses strong baselines in accuracy, consistency and generalization.

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is vital for advancing robotic surgery, improving surgeon guidance, and enabling automation. Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance.

Abstract: Generating semantically aligned human motion from textual descriptions has made rapid progress, but ensuring both semantic and physical realism in motion remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce the Distortion-aware Motion Calibrator (DMC), a post-hoc module that refines physically implausible motions (e.g., foot floating) while preserving semantic consistency with the original textual description. Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency. The experimental results show that DMC reduces FID score by 42.74% on T2M and 13.20% on T2M-GPT, while also achieving the highest R-Precision. When applied to high-quality models like MoMask, DMC improves the physical plausibility of motions by reducing penetration by 33.0% as well as adjusting floating artifacts closer to the ground-truth reference. These results highlight that DMC can serve as a promising post-hoc motion refinement framework for any kind of text-to-motion models by incorporating textual semantics and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), offering new possibilities for navigation decision-making that could benefit both robotic platforms and human users. However, real-world navigation is inherently conditioned by the agent's mobility constraints. For example, a sweeping robot cannot traverse stairs, while a quadruped can. We introduce Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav), a benchmark designed to evaluate how well VLMs can navigate complex indoor spaces given an agent's specific physical and operational capabilities. CapNav defines five representative human and robot agents, each described with physical dimensions, mobility capabilities, and environmental interaction abilities. CapNav provides 45 real-world indoor scenes, 473 navigation tasks, and 2365 QA pairs to test if VLMs can traverse indoor environments based on agent capabilities. We evaluate 13 modern VLMs and find that current VLM's navigation performance drops sharply as mobility constraints tighten, and that even state-of-the-art models struggle with obstacle types that require reasoning on spatial dimensions. We conclude by discussing the implications for capability-aware navigation and the opportunities for advancing embodied spatial reasoning in future VLMs. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/makeabilitylab/CapNav

Abstract: Discrete image tokenizers encode visual inputs as sequences of tokens from a finite vocabulary and are gaining popularity in multimodal systems, including encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models. However, unlike CLIP encoders, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has not been explored. Ours being the first work studying this topic, we first formulate attacks that aim to perturb the features extracted by discrete tokenizers, and thus change the extracted tokens. These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data. Unlike supervised adversarial training, our approach can leverage unlabeled images, making it more versatile. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of tokenizer robustness in downstream tasks and presents an important step in the development of safe multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Multi-Instance Generation has advanced significantly in spatial placement and attribute binding. However, existing approaches still face challenges in fine-grained semantic understanding, particularly when dealing with complex textual descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose DEIG, a novel framework for fine-grained and controllable multi-instance generation. DEIG integrates an Instance Detail Extractor (IDE) that transforms text encoder embeddings into compact, instance-aware representations, and a Detail Fusion Module (DFM) that applies instance-based masked attention to prevent attribute leakage across instances. These components enable DEIG to generate visually coherent multi-instance scenes that precisely match rich, localized textual descriptions. To support fine-grained supervision, we construct a high-quality dataset with detailed, compositional instance captions generated by VLMs. We also introduce DEIG-Bench, a new benchmark with region-level annotations and multi-attribute prompts for both humans and objects. Experiments demonstrate that DEIG consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks in spatial consistency, semantic accuracy, and compositional generalization. Moreover, DEIG functions as a plug-and-play module, making it easily integrable into standard diffusion-based pipelines.

Abstract: Sketches offer designers a concise yet expressive medium for early-stage fashion ideation by specifying structure, silhouette, and spatial relationships, while textual descriptions complement sketches to convey material, color, and stylistic details. Effectively combining textual and visual modalities requires adherence to the sketch visual structure when leveraging the guidance of localized attributes from text. We present LOcalized Text and Sketch with multi-level guidance (LOTS), a framework that enhances fashion image generation by combining global sketch guidance with multiple localized sketch-text pairs. LOTS employs a Multi-level Conditioning Stage to independently encode local features within a shared latent space while maintaining global structural coordination. Then, the Diffusion Pair Guidance stage integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we develop Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Sketchy provides high-quality, clean sketches with a professional look and consistent structure. To assess robustness beyond this setting, we also include an "in the wild" split with non-expert sketches, featuring higher variability and imperfections. Experiments demonstrate that our method strengthens global structural adherence while leveraging richer localized semantic guidance, achieving improvement over state-of-the-art. The dataset, platform, and code are publicly available.

Abstract: High-quality image acquisition in real-world environments remains challenging due to complex illumination variations and inherent limitations of camera imaging pipelines. These issues are exacerbated in multi-view capture, where differences in lighting, sensor responses, and image signal processor (ISP) configurations introduce photometric and chromatic inconsistencies that violate the assumptions of photometric consistency underlying modern 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leading to degraded reconstruction and rendering quality. We propose Luminance-GS++, a 3DGS-based framework for robust NVS under diverse illumination conditions. Our method combines a globally view-adaptive lightness adjustment with a local pixel-wise residual refinement for precise color correction. We further design unsupervised objectives that jointly enforce lightness correction and multi-view geometric and photometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across challenging scenarios, including low-light, overexposure, and complex luminance and chromatic variations. Unlike prior approaches that modify the underlying representation, our method preserves the explicit 3DGS formulation, improving reconstruction fidelity while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Building practical filtrations on objects to detect topological and geometric features is an important task in the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). In this paper, leveraging the ability of the Laplacian of Gaussian operator to enhance the boundaries of medical images, we define the G-LoG (Gaussian-Laplacian of Gaussian) bi-filtration to generate the features more suitable for multi-parameter persistence module. By modeling volumetric images as bounded functions, then we prove the interleaving distance on the persistence modules obtained from our bi-filtrations on the bounded functions is stable with respect to the maximum norm of the bounded functions. Finally, we conduct experiments on the MedMNIST dataset, comparing our bi-filtration against single-parameter filtration and the established deep learning baselines, including Google AutoML Vision, ResNet, AutoKeras and auto-sklearn. Experiments results demonstrate that our bi-filtration significantly outperforms single-parameter filtration. Notably, a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained on the topological features generated by our bi-filtration achieves performance comparable to complex deep learning models trained on the original dataset.

Abstract: Object detectors achieve strong performance under nominal imaging conditions but can fail silently when exposed to blur, noise, compression, adverse weather, or resolution changes. In safety-critical settings, it is therefore insufficient to produce predictions without assessing whether the input remains within the detector's nominal operating regime. We refer to this capability as self-aware object detection.
  We introduce a degradation-aware self-awareness framework based on degradation manifolds, which explicitly structure a detector's feature space according to image degradation rather than semantic content. Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling.
  To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence.
  Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift. These results suggest that degradation-aware representation geometry provides a practical and detector-agnostic foundation.

Abstract: Despite the successes of deep learning in computer vision, difficulties persist in recognizing objects that have undergone group-symmetric transformations rarely seen during training-for example objects seen in unusual poses, scales, positions, or combinations thereof. Equivariant neural networks are a solution to the problem of generalizing across symmetric transformations, but require knowledge of transformations a priori. An alternative family of architectures proposes to earn equivariant operators in a latent space from examples of symmetric transformations. Here, using simple datasets of rotated and translated noisy MNIST, we illustrate how such architectures can successfully be harnessed for out-of-distribution classification, thus overcoming the limitations of both traditional and equivariant networks. While conceptually enticing, we discuss challenges ahead on the path of scaling these architectures to more complex datasets.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) demands generative models that respond to users' tracked real-world motion, yet current video world models accept only coarse control signals such as text or keyboard input, limiting their utility for embodied interaction. We introduce a human-centric video world model that is conditioned on both tracked head pose and joint-level hand poses. For this purpose, we evaluate existing diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and propose an effective mechanism for 3D head and hand control, enabling dexterous hand--object interactions. We train a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher using this strategy and distill it into a causal, interactive system that generates egocentric virtual environments. We evaluate this generated reality system with human subjects and demonstrate improved task performance as well as a significantly higher level of perceived amount of control over the performed actions compared with relevant baselines.

Abstract: As embodied agents become central to VR, telepresence, and digital human applications, their motion must go beyond speech-aligned gestures: agents should turn toward users, respond to their movement, and maintain natural gaze. Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. Please see https://evonneng.github.io/sarah/ for details.

Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models to robustly encode, store, and retrieve information from a continuous video stream to support accurate video question answering (VQA). Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames. To address this, we introduce an adaptive selection strategy that reduces token redundancy while preserving local spatiotemporal information. We further propose a training-free retrieval mixture-of-experts that leverages external models to better identify relevant frames. Our method, MemStream, achieves +8.0% on CG-Bench, +8.5% on LVBench, and +2.4% on VideoMME (Long) over ReKV with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Abstract: Mineral prospectivity mapping requires synthesizing heterogeneous geological knowledge, including textual deposit models and geospatial datasets, to identify regions likely to host specific mineral deposit types. This process is traditionally manual and knowledge-intensive. We present QueryPlot, a semantic retrieval and mapping framework that integrates large-scale geological text corpora with geologic map data using modern Natural Language Processing techniques. We curate descriptive deposit models for over 120 deposit types and transform the State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) polygons into structured textual representations. Given a user-defined natural language query, the system encodes both queries and region descriptions using a pretrained embedding model and computes semantic similarity scores to rank and spatially visualize regions as continuous evidence layers. QueryPlot supports compositional querying over deposit characteristics, enabling aggregation of multiple similarity-derived layers for multi-criteria prospectivity analysis. In a case study on tungsten skarn deposits, we demonstrate that embedding-based retrieval achieves high recall of known occurrences and produces prospective regions that closely align with expert-defined permissive tracts. Furthermore, similarity scores can be incorporated as additional features in supervised learning pipelines, yielding measurable improvements in classification performance. QueryPlot is implemented as a web-based system supporting interactive querying, visualization, and export of GIS-compatible prospectivity layers.To support future research, we have made the source code and datasets used in this study publicly available.

Abstract: Neuroscience has uncovered a fundamental mechanism of our social nature: human brain activity becomes synchronized with others in many social contexts involving interaction. Traditionally, social minds have been regarded as an exclusive property of living beings. Although large language models (LLMs) are widely accepted as powerful approximations of human behavior, with multi-LLM system being extensively explored to enhance their capabilities, it remains controversial whether they can be meaningfully compared to human social minds. In this work, we explore neural synchrony between socially interacting LLMs as an empirical evidence for this debate. Specifically, we introduce neural synchrony during social simulations as a novel proxy for analyzing the sociality of LLMs at the representational level. Through carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that it reliably reflects both social engagement and temporal alignment in their interactions. Our findings indicate that neural synchrony between LLMs is strongly correlated with their social performance, highlighting an important link between neural synchrony and the social behaviors of LLMs. Our work offers a new perspective to examine the "social minds" of LLMs, highlighting surprising parallels in the internal dynamics that underlie human and LLM social interaction.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that larger language models have better predictive power for eye movement and reading time data. While even the best models under-allocate probability mass to human responses, larger models assign higher-quality estimates of next tokens and their likelihood of production in cloze data because they are less sensitive to lexical co-occurrence statistics while being better aligned semantically to human cloze responses. The results provide support for the claim that the greater memorization capacity of larger models helps them guess more semantically appropriate words, but makes them less sensitive to low-level information that is relevant for word recognition.

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction. Taken together, these insights offer a practical diagnostic for steering unreliability and motivate the development of more robust steering methods that explicitly account for non-linear latent behavior representations.

Abstract: Traditional neural topic models are typically optimized by reconstructing the document's Bag-of-Words (BoW) representations, overlooking contextual information and struggling with data sparsity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to construct semantically-grounded soft label targets using Language Models (LMs) by projecting the next token probabilities, conditioned on a specialized prompt, onto a pre-defined vocabulary to obtain contextually enriched supervision signals. By training the topic models to reconstruct the soft labels using the LM hidden states, our method produces higher-quality topics that are more closely aligned with the underlying thematic structure of the corpus. Experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves substantial improvements in topic coherence, purity over existing baselines. Additionally, we also introduce a retrieval-based metric, which shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying semantically similar documents, highlighting its effectiveness for retrieval-oriented applications.

Abstract: Current biomedical question answering (QA) systems often assume that medical knowledge applies uniformly, yet real-world clinical reasoning is inherently conditional: nearly every decision depends on patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and contraindications. Existing benchmarks do not evaluate such conditional reasoning, and retrieval-augmented or graph-based methods lack explicit mechanisms to ensure that retrieved knowledge is applicable to given context. To address this gap, we propose CondMedQA, the first benchmark for conditional biomedical QA, consisting of multi-hop questions whose answers vary with patient conditions. Furthermore, we propose Condition-Gated Reasoning (CGR), a novel framework that constructs condition-aware knowledge graphs and selectively activates or prunes reasoning paths based on query conditions. Our findings show that CGR more reliably selects condition-appropriate answers while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on biomedical QA benchmarks, highlighting the importance of explicitly modeling conditionality for robust medical reasoning.

Abstract: Instruction optimization provides a lightweight, model-agnostic approach to enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first systematic comparison of instruction optimization, based on the DSPy optimization framework, for tabular fact verification. We evaluate four out-of-the-box prompting techniques that cover both text-only prompting and code use: direct prediction, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct with SQL tools, and CodeAct with Python execution. We study three optimizers from the DSPy framework -- COPRO, MiPROv2, and SIMBA -- across four benchmarks and three model families. We find that instruction optimization consistently improves verification accuracy, with MiPROv2 yielding the most stable gains for CoT, and SIMBA providing the largest benefits for ReAct agents, particularly at larger model scales. Behavioral analyses reveal that SIMBA encourages more direct reasoning paths by applying heuristics, thereby improving numerical comparison abilities in CoT reasoning and helping avoid unnecessary tool calls in ReAct agents. Across different prompting techniques, CoT remains effective for tabular fact checking, especially with smaller models. Although ReAct agents built with larger models can achieve competitive performance, they require careful instruction optimization.

Abstract: Background: Clinical named entity recognition tools commonly map free text to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). For many downstream tasks, however, the clinically meaningful unit is not a single CUI but a concept set comprising related synonyms, subtypes, and supertypes. Constructing such concept sets is labour-intensive, inconsistently performed, and poorly supported by existing tools, particularly for NLP pipelines that operate directly on UMLS CUIs. Methods We present CUICurate, a Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework for automated UMLS concept set curation. A UMLS knowledge graph (KG) was constructed and embedded for semantic retrieval. For each target concept, candidate CUIs were retrieved from the KG, followed by large language model (LLM) filtering and classification steps comparing two LLMs (GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini). The framework was evaluated on five lexically heterogeneous clinical concepts against a manually curated benchmark and gold-standard concept sets. Results Across all concepts, CUICurate produced substantially larger and more complete concept sets than the manual benchmarks whilst matching human precision. Comparisons between the two LLMs found that GPT-5-mini achieved higher recall during filtering, while GPT-5 produced classifications that more closely aligned with clinician judgements. Outputs were stable across repeated runs and computationally inexpensive. Conclusions CUICurate offers a scalable and reproducible approach to support UMLS concept set curation that substantially reduces manual effort. By integrating graph-based retrieval with LLM reasoning, the framework produces focused candidate concept sets that can be adapted to clinical NLP pipelines for different phenotyping and analytic requirements.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation is increasingly used for financial question answering over long regulatory filings, yet reliability depends on retrieving the exact context needed to justify answers in high stakes settings. We study a frequent failure mode in which the correct document is retrieved but the page or chunk that contains the answer is missed, leading the generator to extrapolate from incomplete context. Despite its practical significance, this within-document retrieval failure mode has received limited systematic attention in the Financial Question Answering (QA) literature. We evaluate retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, document, page, and chunk level, and introduce an oracle based analysis to provide empirical upper bounds on retrieval and generative performance. On a 150 question subset of FinanceBench, we reproduce and compare diverse retrieval strategies including dense, sparse, hybrid, and hierarchical methods with reranking and query reformulation. Across methods, gains in document discovery tend to translate into stronger page recall, yet oracle performance still suggests headroom for page and chunk level retrieval. To target this gap, we introduce a domain fine-tuned page scorer that treats pages as an intermediate retrieval unit between documents and chunks. Unlike prior passage-based hierarchical retrieval, we fine-tune a bi-encoder specifically for page-level relevance on financial filings, exploiting the semantic coherence of pages. Overall, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in page recall and chunk retrieval.

Abstract: Evaluation is no longer a final checkpoint in the machine learning lifecycle. As AI systems evolve from static models to compound, tool-using agents, evaluation becomes a core control function. The question is no longer "How good is the model?" but "Can we trust the system to behave as intended, under change, at scale?". Yet most evaluation practices remain anchored in assumptions inherited from the model-centric era: static benchmarks, aggregate scores, and one-off success criteria. This paper argues that such approaches are increasingly obscure rather than illuminating system behavior. We examine how evaluation pipelines themselves introduce silent failure modes, why high benchmark scores routinely mislead teams, and how agentic systems fundamentally alter the meaning of performance measurement. Rather than proposing new metrics or harder benchmarks, we aim to clarify the role of evaluation in the AI era, and especially for agents: not as performance theater, but as a measurement discipline that conditions trust, iteration, and governance in non-deterministic systems.

Abstract: Conversational AI has been proposed as a scalable way to correct public misconceptions and spread misinformation. Yet its effectiveness may depend on perceptions of its political neutrality. As LLMs enter partisan conflict, elites increasingly portray them as ideologically aligned. We test whether these credibility attacks reduce LLM-based persuasion. In a preregistered U.S. survey experiment (N=2144), participants completed a three-round conversation with ChatGPT about a personally held economic policy misconception. Compared to a neutral control, a short message indicating that the LLM was biased against the respondent's party attenuated persuasion by 28%. Transcript analysis indicates that the warnings alter the interaction: respondents push back more and engage less receptively. These findings suggest that the persuasive impact of conversational AI is politically contingent, constrained by perceptions of partisan alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite extensive pretraining on broad internet corpora, often struggle to adapt effectively to specialized domains. There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To overcome these gaps, we propose an adversarial question-generation framework that produces a compact set of semantically challenging questions. These questions are constructed by comparing the outputs of the model to be adapted and a robust expert model grounded in reference documents, using an iterative, feedback-driven process designed to reveal and address comprehension gaps. Evaluation on specialized subsets of the LegalBench corpus demonstrates that our method achieves greater accuracy with substantially fewer synthetic samples.

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in context-based generation. Prior work has explored intrinsic signals available during generation, among which attention offers a direct view of grounding behavior. However, existing approaches typically rely on coarse summaries that fail to capture fine-grained instabilities in attention. Inspired by signal processing, we introduce a frequency-aware perspective on attention by analyzing its variation during generation. We model attention distributions as discrete signals and extract high-frequency components that reflect rapid local changes in attention. Our analysis reveals that hallucinated tokens are associated with high-frequency attention energy, reflecting fragmented and unstable grounding behavior. Based on this insight, we develop a lightweight hallucination detector using high-frequency attention features. Experiments on the RAGTruth and HalluRAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves performance gains over verification-based, internal-representation-based, and attention-based methods across models and tasks.

Abstract: Large language models generate text through probabilistic sampling from high-dimensional distributions, yet how this process reshapes the structural statistical organization of language remains incompletely characterized. Here we show that lossless compression provides a simple, model-agnostic measure of statistical regularity that differentiates generative regimes directly from surface text. We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation. Overall, our findings introduce a simple and robust framework for quantifying how generative systems reshape textual production, offering a structural perspective on the evolving complexity of communication.

Abstract: Jailbreaking poses a significant risk to the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). VLMs are particularly vulnerable because they process both text and images, creating broader attack surfaces. However, available resources for jailbreak detection are scarce, particularly in finance. To address this gap, we present FENCE, a bilingual (Korean-English) multimodal dataset for training and evaluating jailbreak detectors in financial applications. FENCE emphasizes domain realism through finance-relevant queries paired with image-grounded threats. Experiments with commercial and open-source VLMs reveal consistent vulnerabilities, with GPT-4o showing measurable attack success rates and open-source models displaying greater exposure. A baseline detector trained on FENCE achieves 99 percent in-distribution accuracy and maintains strong performance on external benchmarks, underscoring the dataset's robustness for training reliable detection models. FENCE provides a focused resource for advancing multimodal jailbreak detection in finance and for supporting safer, more reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer greater flexibility in decoding order than autoregressive models but require careful planning to achieve high-quality generation. Existing samplers typically adopt greedy heuristics, prioritizing positions with the highest local certainty to decode at each step. Through failure case analysis, we identify a fundamental limitation of this approach: it neglects the downstream impact of current decoding choices on subsequent steps and fails to minimize cumulative uncertainty. In particular, these methods do not fully exploit the non-causal nature of MDMs, which enables evaluating how a decoding decision reshapes token probabilities/uncertainty across all remaining masked positions. To bridge this gap, we propose the Info-Gain Sampler, a principled decoding framework that balances immediate uncertainty with information gain over future masked tokens. Extensive evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing, and image generation) demonstrate that Info-Gain Sampler consistently outperforms existing samplers for MDMs. For instance, it achieves a 3.6% improvement in average accuracy on reasoning tasks and a 63.1% win-rate in creative writing. Notably, on reasoning tasks it reduces cumulative uncertainty from 78.4 to 48.6, outperforming the best baseline by a large margin.

Abstract: Real-time sentence comprehension imposes a significant load on working memory, as comprehenders must maintain contextual information to anticipate future input. While measures of such load have played an important role in psycholinguistic theories, they have been formalized, largely, using symbolic grammars, which assign discrete, uniform costs to syntactic predictions. This study proposes a measure of processing storage cost based on an information-theoretic formalization, as the amount of information previous words carry about future context, under uncertainty. Unlike previous discrete, grammar-based metrics, this measure is continuous, theory-neutral, and can be estimated from pre-trained neural language models. The validity of this approach is demonstrated through three analyses in English: our measure (i) recovers well-known processing asymmetries in center embeddings and relative clauses, (ii) correlates with a grammar-based storage cost in a syntactically-annotated corpus, and (iii) predicts reading-time variance in two large-scale naturalistic datasets over and above baseline models with traditional information-based predictors.

Abstract: Recent work on test-time scaling for large language model (LLM) reasoning typically assumes that allocating more inference-time computation uniformly improves correctness. However, prior studies show that reasoning uncertainty is highly localized: a small subset of low-confidence tokens disproportionately contributes to reasoning errors and unnecessary output expansion. Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy. Our code will be made available at: https://github.com/bolo-web/CCD.

Abstract: While mechanistic interpretability has developed powerful tools to analyze the internal workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), their complexity has created an accessibility gap, limiting their use to specialists. We address this challenge by designing, building, and evaluating ELIA (Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis), an interactive web application that simplifies the outcomes of various language model component analyses for a broader audience. The system integrates three key techniques -- Attribution Analysis, Function Vector Analysis, and Circuit Tracing -- and introduces a novel methodology: using a vision-language model to automatically generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for the complex visualizations produced by these methods. The effectiveness of this approach was empirically validated through a mixed-methods user study, which revealed a clear preference for interactive, explorable interfaces over simpler, static visualizations. A key finding was that the AI-powered explanations helped bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts; a statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between a user's prior LLM experience and their comprehension scores, suggesting that the system reduced barriers to comprehension across experience levels. We conclude that an AI system can indeed simplify complex model analyses, but its true power is unlocked when paired with thoughtful, user-centered design that prioritizes interactivity, specificity, and narrative guidance.

Abstract: Psychological corpora in NLP are collections of texts used to analyze human psychology, emotions, and mental health. These texts allow researchers to study psychological constructs, detect mental health issues and analyze emotional language. However, mental health data can be difficult to collect correctly from social media, due to suppositions made by the collectors. A more pragmatic strategy involves gathering data through open-ended questions and then assessing this information with self-report screening surveys. This method was employed successfully for English, a language with a lot of psychological NLP resources. However, this cannot be stated for Romanian, which currently has no open-source mental health corpus. To address this gap, we have created the first corpus for depression and anxiety in Romanian, by utilizing a form with 6 open-ended questions along with the standardized PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening questionnaires. Consisting of the texts of 205 respondents and although it may seem small, PsihoRo is a first step towards understanding and analyzing texts regarding the mental health of the Romanian population. We employ statistical analysis, text analysis using Romanian LIWC, emotion detection and topic modeling to show what are the most important features of this newly introduced resource to the NLP community.

Abstract: We describe a modern deep learning system that automatically identifies informative contextual examples (\qu{contexts}) for first language vocabulary instruction for high school student. Our paper compares three modeling approaches: (i) an unsupervised similarity-based strategy using MPNet's uniformly contextualized embeddings, (ii) a supervised framework built on instruction-aware, fine-tuned Qwen3 embeddings with a nonlinear regression head and (iii) model (ii) plus handcrafted context features. We introduce a novel metric called the Retention Competency Curve to visualize trade-offs between the discarded proportion of good contexts and the \qu{good-to-bad} contexts ratio providing a compact, unified lens on model performance. Model (iii) delivers the most dramatic gains with performance of a good-to-bad ratio of 440 all while only throwing out 70\% of the good contexts. In summary, we demonstrate that a modern embedding model on neural network architecture, when guided by human supervision, results in a low-cost large supply of near-perfect contexts for teaching vocabulary for a variety of target words.

Abstract: In jurisdictions like India, where courts face an extensive backlog of cases, artificial intelligence offers transformative potential for legal judgment prediction. A critical subset of this backlog comprises appellate cases, which are formal decisions issued by higher courts reviewing the rulings of lower courts. To this end, we present Vichara, a novel framework tailored to the Indian judicial system that predicts and explains appellate judgments. Vichara processes English-language appellate case proceeding documents and decomposes them into decision points. Decision points are discrete legal determinations that encapsulate the legal issue, deciding authority, outcome, reasoning, and temporal context. The structured representation isolates the core determinations and their context, enabling accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. Vichara's explanations follow a structured format inspired by the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) framework and adapted for Indian legal reasoning. This enhances interpretability, allowing legal professionals to assess the soundness of predictions efficiently. We evaluate Vichara on two datasets, PredEx and the expert-annotated subset of the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC_expert), using four large language models: GPT-4o mini, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B. Vichara surpasses existing judgment prediction benchmarks on both datasets, with GPT-4o mini achieving the highest performance (F1: 81.5 on PredEx, 80.3 on ILDC_expert), followed by Llama-3.1-8B. Human evaluation of the generated explanations across Clarity, Linking, and Usefulness metrics highlights GPT-4o mini's superior interpretability.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge representation often requires capturing subjective, continuous attributes -- such as political positions -- that conflict with pairwise validation, the widely accepted gold standard for human evaluation. We address this challenge through a dual-scale validation framework applied to political stance prediction in argumentative discourse, combining pointwise and pairwise human annotation. Using 22 language models, we construct a large-scale knowledge base of political position predictions for 23,228 arguments drawn from 30 debates that appeared on the UK politicial television programme \textit{Question Time}. Pointwise evaluation shows moderate human-model agreement (Krippendorff's $α=0.578$), reflecting intrinsic subjectivity, while pairwise validation reveals substantially stronger alignment between human- and model-derived rankings ($α=0.86$ for the best model). This work contributes: (i) a practical validation methodology for subjective continuous knowledge that balances scalability with reliability; (ii) a validated structured argumentation knowledge base enabling graph-based reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation in political domains; and (iii) evidence that ordinal structure can be extracted from pointwise language models predictions from inherently subjective real-world discourse, advancing knowledge representation capabilities for domains where traditional symbolic or categorical approaches are insufficient.

Abstract: Comprehensively retrieving diverse documents is crucial to address queries that admit a wide range of valid answers. We introduce retrieve-verify-retrieve (RVR), a multi-round retrieval framework designed to maximize answer coverage. Initially, a retriever takes the original query and returns a candidate document set, followed by a verifier that identifies a high-quality subset. For subsequent rounds, the query is augmented with previously verified documents to uncover answers that are not yet covered in previous rounds. RVR is effective even with off-the-shelf retrievers, and fine-tuning retrievers for our inference procedure brings further gains. Our method outperforms baselines, including agentic search approaches, achieving at least 10% relative and 3% absolute gain in complete recall percentage on a multi-answer retrieval dataset (QAMPARI). We also see consistent gains on two out-of-domain datasets (QUEST and WebQuestionsSP) across different base retrievers. Our work presents a promising iterative approach for comprehensive answer recall leveraging a verifier and adapting retrievers to a new inference scenario.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in reasoning tasks across various domains such as mathematics and coding. However, their performance deteriorates in tasks requiring rich socio-cultural knowledge and diverse local contexts, particularly those involving Indian Culture. Existing Cultural benchmarks are (i) Manually crafted, (ii) contain single-hop questions testing factual recall, and (iii) prohibitively costly to scale, leaving this deficiency largely unmeasured. To address this, we introduce VIRAASAT, a novel, semi-automated multi-hop approach for generating cultural specific multi-hop Question-Answering dataset for Indian culture. VIRAASAT leverages a Knowledge Graph comprising more than 700 expert-curated cultural artifacts, covering 13 key attributes of Indian culture (history, festivals, etc). VIRAASAT spans all 28 states and 8 Union Territories, yielding more than 3,200 multi-hop questions that necessitate chained cultural reasoning. We evaluate current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs on VIRAASAT and identify key limitations in reasoning wherein fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought(CoT) traces fails to ground and synthesize low-probability facts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named Symbolic Chain-of-Manipulation (SCoM). Adapting the Chain-of-Manipulation paradigm, we train the model to simulate atomic Knowledge Graph manipulations internally. SCoM teaches the model to reliably traverse the topological structure of the graph. Experiments on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) demonstrate that SCoM outperforms standard CoT baselines by up to 20%. We release the VIRAASAT dataset along with our findings, laying a strong foundation towards building Culturally Aware Reasoning Models.

It is shown that these mappings hold only under restrictive conditions, notably system normality, which limits their applicability in inverter-dominated power systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In many data-driven online decision systems, actions determine not only operational costs but also the data availability for future learning -- a phenomenon termed Prediction-Induced Censoring (PIC). This challenge is particularly acute in large-scale resource allocation for generative AI (GenAI) serving: insufficient capacity triggers shortages but hides the true demand, leaving the system with only a "greater-than" constraint. Standard decision-making approaches that rely on uncensored data suffer from selection bias, often locking the system into a self-reinforcing low-provisioning trap. To break this loop, this paper proposes an adaptive approach named PIC-Reinforcement Learning (PIC-RL), a closed-loop framework that transforms censoring from a data quality problem into a decision signal. PIC-RL integrates (1) Uncertainty-Aware Demand Prediction to manage the information-cost trade-off, (2) Pessimistic Surrogate Inference to construct decision-aligned conservative feedback from shortage events, and (3) Dual-Timescale Adaptation to stabilize online learning against distribution drift. The analysis provides theoretical guarantees that the feedback design corrects the selection bias inherent in naive learning. Experiments on production Alibaba GenAI traces demonstrate that PIC-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing service degradation by up to 50% while maintaining cost efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a geometric method for online transfer identification of a deterministic linear time-invariant system. At the beginning of the identification process, we assume access to abundant data from a system that is similar, though not identical, to the true system. In the early stages of data collection from the true system, the dataset generated is still not sufficiently informative to enable precise identification. Consequently, multiple candidate models remain consistent with the observations available at that point. Our method picks, at each instant, the model closest to the similar system that is consistent with the current data. As more data are collected, the proposed model gradually moves away from the initial similar system and eventually converges to the true system when the data set grows to be informative. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the incremental transfer identification paradigm, where identified models with minimal data are used to solve the pole placement problem.

Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), e.g., Smart Wires, and Network Topology Optimization (NTO) schemes for mitigating operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. This work aims to optimize and coordinate the operation of distributed VIDs considering fixed and optimized topologies. This problem is inherently non-linear due to power flow equations as well as bilinear terms introduced due to variable line impedance of VIDs. Furthermore, the topology optimization scheme makes it a mixed integer nonlinear problem. To tackle this, we introduce using McCormick relaxation scheme, which converts the bilinear constraints into a linear set of constraints along with the DC power flow equations. We propose an iterative correction of the McCormick relaxation to enhance its accuracy. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, and we present a performance comparison of the iterative McCormick method against the non-linear, SOS2 piecewise linear approximation, and original McCormick relaxation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid output-feedback control framework for average dwell-time (ADT) switched linear systems subject to actuator saturation. The considered subsystems may be exponentially unstable, and the saturation nonlinearity is explicitly handled through a deadzone-based representation. The proposed hybrid controller combines mode-dependent full-order dynamic output-feedback controllers with a supervisory reset mechanism that updates controller states at switching instants. By incorporating the reset rule directly into the synthesis conditions, switching boundary constraints and performance requirements are addressed in a unified convex formulation. Sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee exponential stability under ADT switching and a prescribed weighted ${\cal L}_2$-gain disturbance attenuation level for energy-bounded disturbances. An explicit controller construction algorithm is provided based on feasible LMI solutions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational tractability of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over existing output-feedback saturation control methods.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is a crucial requirement for the reliable operation and control of electric power systems. Here, we construct a data-driven, numerical method to infer missing power load values in large-scale power grids. Given partial observations of power demands, the method estimates the operational state using a linear regression algorithm, exploiting statistical correlations within synthetic training datasets. We evaluate the performance of the method on three synthetic transmission grid test systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by the method in reconstructing missing demand values under various operating conditions. We further apply the method to real data for the transmission power grid of Switzerland. Despite the restricted number of observations in this dataset, the method infers missing power loads rather accurately. Furthermore, Newton-Raphson power flow solutions show that deviations between true and inferred values for power loads result in smaller deviations between true and inferred values for flows on power lines. This ensures that the estimated operational state correctly captures potential line contingencies. Overall, our results indicate that simple data-based regression techniques can provide an efficient and reliable alternative for state estimation in modern power grids.

Abstract: Solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems at kilohertz (kHz) rates on standard processors remains a formidable challenge. This paper proposes a Koopman-BoxQP framework that i) learns a linear Koopman high-dimensional model, ii) eliminates the high-dimensional observables to construct a multi-step prediction model of the states and control inputs, iii) penalizes the multi-step prediction model into the objective, which results in a structured box-constrained quadratic program (BoxQP) whose decision variables include both the system states and control inputs, iv) develops a structure-exploited and warm-starting-supported variant of the feasible Mehrotra's interior-point algorithm for BoxQP. Numerical results demonstrate that Koopman-BoxQP can solve a large-scale NMPC problem with $1040$ variables and $2080$ inequalities at a kHz rate.

Abstract: This paper presents a Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI) based resource accreditation framework for capacity market design. Under this framework, a resource is accredited based on its marginal impact on system reliability, thus aligning the resource accreditation value with its reliability contribution. A key feature of the MRI based accreditation is that the accredited capacities supplied by different resources to the capacity market are substitutable in reliability contribution, a desired feature of homogeneous products. Moreover, with MRI based capacity demand, substitutability between supply and demand for capacity is also achieved. As a result, a capacity market with the MRI based capacity product can better characterize the underlying resource adequacy problem and lead to more efficient market outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper, constrained parameter update laws for adaptive control with convex equality constraint on the parameters are developed, one based on a gradient only update and the other incorporating concurrent learning (CL) update. The update laws are derived by solving a constrained optimization problem with affine equality constraints. This constrained problem is reformulated as an equivalent unconstrained problem in a new variable, thereby eliminating the equality constraints. The resulting update law is integrated with an adaptive trajectory tracking controller, enabling online learning of the unknown system parameters. Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system with the equality-constrained parameter update law is established. The effectiveness of the proposed equality-constrained adaptive control law is demonstrated through simulations, validating its ability to maintain constraints on the parameter estimates, achieving convergence to the true parameters for CL-based update law, and achieving asymptotic and exponential tracking performance for constrained gradient and constrained CL-based update laws, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the contractivity of nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by deterministic inputs and Brownian motions. Given a weighted $\ell_2$-norm for the state space, we show that an SDE is incrementally noise- and input-to-state stable if its vector field is uniformly contracting in the state and uniformly Lipschitz in the input. This result is applied to error estimation for time-varying equilibrium tracking in the presence of noise affecting both the system dynamics and the input signals. We consider both Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes modeling unbounded noise and Jacobi diffusion processes modeling bounded noise. Finally, we turn our attention to the associated Fokker-Planck equation of an SDE. For this context, we prove incremental input-to-state stability with respect to an arbitrary $p$-Wasserstein metric when the drift vector field is uniformly contracting in the state and uniformly Lipschitz in the input with respect to an arbitrary norm.

Abstract: Designing robust trajectories under uncertainties is an emerging technology that may represent a key paradigm shift in space mission design. As we pursue more ambitious scientific goals (e.g., multi-moon tours, missions with extensive components of autonomy), it becomes more crucial that missions are designed with navigation (Nav) processes in mind. The effect of Nav processes is statistical by nature, as they consist of orbit determination (OD) and flight-path control (FPC). Thus, this mission design paradigm calls for techniques that appropriately quantify statistical effects of Nav, evaluate associated risks, and design missions that ensure sufficiently low risk while minimizing a statistical performance metric; a common metric is Delta-V99: worst-case (99%-quantile) Delta-V expenditure including statistical FPC efforts. In response to the need, this paper develops an algorithm for risk-constrained trajectory optimization under operational uncertainties due to initial state dispersion, navigation error, maneuver execution error, and imperfect dynamics modeling. We formulate it as a nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem and develop a computationally tractable algorithm that combines optimal covariance steering and sequential convex programming (SCP). Specifically, the proposed algorithm takes a block-Cholesky approach for convex formulation of optimal covariance steering, and leverages a recent SCP algorithm, SCvx*, for reliable numerical convergence. We apply the developed algorithm to risk-constrained, statistical trajectory optimization for exploration of dwarf planet Ceres with a Mars gravity assist, and demonstrate the robustness of the statistically-optimal trajectory and FPC policies via nonlinear Monte Carlo simulation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mutual adaptation is a central challenge in human--AI teaming, as humans naturally adjust their strategies in response to a robot's policy. Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions.

Abstract: Squatting is one of the most demanding lower-limb movements, requiring substantial muscular effort and coordination. Reducing the physical demands of this task through intelligent and personalized assistance has significant implications, particularly in industries involving repetitive low-level assembly activities. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neural network controller for a modular Hip-Knee exoskeleton designed to assist squatting tasks. The neural network controller was trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a physics-based, human-exoskeleton interaction simulation environment. The controller generated real-time hip and knee assistance torques based on recent joint-angle and velocity histories. Five healthy adults performed three-minute metronome-guided squats under three conditions: (1) no exoskeleton (No-Exo), (2) exoskeleton with Zero-Torque, and (3) exoskeleton with active assistance (Assistance). Physiological effort was assessed using indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring, alongside concurrent kinematic data collection. Results show that the RL-based controller adapts to individuals by producing torque profiles tailored to each subject's kinematics and timing. Compared with the Zero-Torque and No-Exo condition, active assistance reduced the net metabolic rate by approximately 10%, with minor reductions observed in heart rate. However, assisted trials also exhibited reduced squat depth, reflected by smaller hip and knee flexion. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed controller can effectively lower physiological effort during repetitive squatting, motivating further improvements in both hardware design and control strategies.

Abstract: Speech enhancement performance degrades significantly in noisy environments, limiting the deployment of speech-controlled technologies in industrial settings, such as manufacturing plants. Existing speech enhancement solutions primarly rely on advanced digital signal processing techniques, deep learning methods, or complex software optimization techniques. This paper introduces a novel enhancement strategy that incorporates a physical optimization stage by dynamically modifying the geometry of a microphone array to adapt to changing acoustic conditions. A sixteen-microphone array is mounted on a robotic arm manipulator with seven degrees of freedom, with microphones divided into four groups of four, including one group positioned near the end-effector. The system reconfigures the array by adjusting the manipulator joint angles to place the end-effector microphones closer to the target speaker, thereby improving the reference signal quality. This proposed method integrates sound source localization techniques, computer vision, inverse kinematics, minimum variance distortionless response beamformer and time-frequency masking using a deep neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other traditional recording configruations, achieving higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and lower word error rate accross multiple input signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

We present WHED, a wearable hand-exoskeleton system designed for in-the-wild demonstration capture, guided by two principles: wearability-first operation for extended use and a pose-tolerant, free-to-move thumb coupling that preserves natural thumb behaviors while maintaining a consistent mapping to the target robot thumb degrees of freedom. WHED integrates a linkage-driven finger interface with passive fit accommodation, a modified passive hand with robust proprioceptive sensing, and an onboard sensing/power module. We also provide an end-to-end data pipeline that synchronizes joint encoders, AR-based end-effector pose, and wrist-mounted visual observations, and supports post-processing for time alignment and replay. We demonstrate feasibility on representative grasping and manipulation sequences spanning precision pinch and full-hand enclosure grasps, and show qualitative consistency between collected demonstrations and replayed executions.

Abstract: Manipulating deformable and fragile objects remains a fundamental challenge in robotics due to complex contact dynamics and strict requirements on object integrity. Existing approaches typically optimize either end-effector design or control strategies in isolation, limiting achievable performance. In this work, we present the first co-design framework that jointly optimizes end-effector morphology and manipulation control for deformable and fragile object manipulation. We introduce (1) a latent diffeomorphic shape parameterization enabling expressive yet tractable end-effector geometry optimization, (2) a stress-aware bi-level co-design pipeline coupling morphology and control optimization, and (3) a privileged-to-pointcloud policy distillation scheme for zero-shot real-world deployment. We evaluate our approach on challenging food manipulation tasks, including grasping and pushing jelly and scooping fillets. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The problem of planning sensing trajectories for a mobile robot to collect observations of a target and predict its future trajectory is known as active target tracking. Enabled by probabilistic motion models, one may solve this problem by exploring the belief space of all trajectory predictions given future sensing actions to maximise information gain. However, for multi-modal motion models the notion of information gain is often ill-defined. This paper proposes a planning approach designed around maximising information regarding the target's homotopy class, or high-level motion. We introduce homotopic information gain, a measure of the expected high-level trajectory information given by a measurement. We show that homotopic information gain is a lower bound for metric or low-level information gain, and is as sparsely distributed in the environment as obstacles are. Planning sensing trajectories to maximise homotopic information results in highly accurate trajectory estimates with fewer measurements than a metric information approach, as supported by our empirical evaluation on real and simulated pedestrian data.

Abstract: Repetitive motion tasks are common in robotics, but performance can degrade over time due to environmental changes and robot wear and tear. Iterative learning control (ILC) improves performance by using information from previous iterations to compensate for expected errors in future iterations. This work incorporates the use of Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Processes (QPGPs) into a predictive ILC framework to model and forecast disturbances and drift across iterations. Using a recent structural equation formulation of QPGPs, the proposed approach enables efficient inference with complexity $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(i^2p^3)$, where $p$ denotes the number of points within an iteration and $i$ represents the total number of iterations, specially for larger $i$. This formulation also enables parameter estimation without loss of information, making continual GP learning computationally feasible within the control loop. By predicting next-iteration error profiles rather than relying only on past errors, the controller achieves faster convergence and maintains this under time-varying disturbances. We benchmark the method against both standard ILC and conventional Gaussian Process (GP)-based predictive ILC on three tasks, autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking, a three-link robotic manipulator, and a real-world Stretch robot experiment. Across all cases, the proposed approach converges faster and remains robust under injected and natural disturbances while reducing computational cost. This highlights its practicality across a range of repetitive dynamical systems.

Abstract: Humans can rearrange objects in cluttered environments using egocentric perception, navigating occlusions without global coordinates. Inspired by this capability, we study long-horizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using a single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a mobile platform in the real world. Code and videos are available at https://ai4ce.github.io/EgoPush/.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for enabling autonomous vehicles to interact with cyclists in a manner that balances safety and optimality. The approach integrates Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis with deep Q-learning to jointly address safety guarantees and time-efficient navigation. A value function is computed as the solution to a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality, providing a quantitative measure of safety for each system state. This safety metric is incorporated as a structured reward signal within a reinforcement learning framework. The method further models the cyclist's latent response to the vehicle, allowing disturbance inputs to reflect human comfort and behavioral adaptation. The proposed framework is evaluated through simulation and comparison with human driving behavior and an existing state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation and multi-modal perception are prerequisites for autonomous legged robots in complex, large-scale environments. To date, no large-scale public legged-robot dataset captures the real-world conditions needed to develop and benchmark algorithms for legged-robot state estimation, perception, and navigation. To address this, we introduce the GrandTour dataset, a multi-modal legged-robotics dataset collected across challenging outdoor and indoor environments, featuring an ANYbotics ANYmal-D quadruped equipped with the \boxi multi-modal sensor payload. GrandTour spans a broad range of environments and operational scenarios across distinct test sites, ranging from alpine scenery and forests to demolished buildings and urban areas, and covers a wide variation in scale, complexity, illumination, and weather conditions. The dataset provides time-synchronized sensor data from spinning LiDARs, multiple RGB cameras with complementary characteristics, proprioceptive sensors, and stereo depth cameras. Moreover, it includes high-precision ground-truth trajectories from satellite-based RTK-GNSS and a Leica Geosystems total station. This dataset supports research in SLAM, high-precision state estimation, and multi-modal learning, enabling rigorous evaluation and development of new approaches to sensor fusion in legged robotic systems. With its extensive scope, GrandTour represents the largest open-access legged-robotics dataset to date. The dataset is available at https://grand-tour.leggedrobotics.com, on HuggingFace (ROS-independent), and in ROS formats, along with tools and demo resources.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have achieved impressive accuracy and dense reconstruction capabilities, yet their robustness to scale inconsistency in large-scale indoor environments remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks are limited to room-scale or structurally simple settings, leaving critical issues of intra-session scale drift and inter-session scale ambiguity insufficiently addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce the ScaleMaster Dataset, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scale consistency under challenging scenarios such as multi-floor structures, long trajectories, repetitive views, and low-texture regions. We systematically analyze the vulnerability of state-of-the-art deep monocular visual SLAM systems to scale inconsistency, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Crucially, our analysis extends beyond traditional trajectory metrics to include a direct map-to-map quality assessment using metrics like Chamfer distance against high-fidelity 3D ground truth. Our results reveal that while recent deep monocular visual SLAM systems demonstrate strong performance on existing benchmarks, they suffer from severe scale-related failures in realistic, large-scale indoor environments. By releasing the ScaleMaster dataset and baseline results, we aim to establish a foundation for future research toward developing scale-consistent and reliable visual SLAM systems.

Abstract: Portable pneumatic systems for 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) soft shoulder exosuits remain underexplored, and face fundamental trade-offs between torque output and dynamic response that are further compounded by the need for multiple actuators to support complex shoulder movement. This work addresses these constraints through a volume-optimized spindle-shaped angled actuator (SSAA) geometry: by reducing actuator volume by 35.7% (357mL vs. 555mL), the SSAA maintains 94.2% of output torque while achieving 35.2% faster dynamic response compared to uniform cylindrical designs. Building on the SSAA, we develop a curved abduction actuator (CAA) based on the SSAA geometry and a horizontal adduction actuator (HAA) based on the pouch motor principle, integrating both into a dual-DOF textile-based shoulder exosuit (390 g). The exosuit delivers multi-modal assistance spanning shoulder abduction, flexion, and horizontal adduction, depending on the actuation.
  User studies with 10 healthy participants reveal that the exosuit substantially reduces electromyographic (EMG) activity across both shoulder abduction and flexion tasks. For abduction with HAA only, the exosuit achieved up to 59% muscle activity reduction across seven muscles. For flexion, both the single-actuator configuration (HAA only) and the dual-actuator configuration (HAA,+,CAA) reduced EMG activity by up to 63.7% compared to no assistance. However, the incremental benefit of adding the CAA to existing HAA support was limited in healthy users during flexion, with statistically significant additional reductions observed only in pectoralis major. These experimental findings characterize actuator contributions in healthy users and provide design guidance for multi-DOF exosuit systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic manipulation, leveraging large-scale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations. Website: https://frontierrobo.github.io/SimVLA

Abstract: Event cameras in motion tend to detect object boundaries or texture edges, which produce lines of brightness changes, especially in man-made environments. While lines can constitute a robust intermediate representation that is consistently observed, the sparse nature of lines may lead to drastic deterioration with minor estimation errors. Only a few previous works, often accompanied by additional sensors, utilize lines to compensate for the severe domain discrepancies of event sensors along with unpredictable noise characteristics. We propose a method that can stably extract tracks of varying appearances of lines using a clever algorithmic process that observes multiple representations from various time slices of events, compensating for potential adversaries within the event data. We then propose geometric cost functions that can refine the 3D line maps and camera poses, eliminating projective distortions and depth ambiguities. The 3D line maps are highly compact and can be equipped with our proposed cost function, which can be adapted for any observations that can detect and extract line structures or projections of them, including 3D point cloud maps or image observations. We demonstrate that our formulation is powerful enough to exhibit a significant performance boost in event-based mapping and pose refinement across diverse datasets, and can be flexibly applied to multimodal scenarios. Our results confirm that the proposed line-based formulation is a robust and effective approach for the practical deployment of event-based perceptual modules.

Abstract: This paper presents a role-adaptive Leader-Follower-based formation planning and control framework for teams of quadruped robots operating in cluttered environments. Unlike conventional methods with fixed leaders or rigid formation roles, the proposed approach integrates dynamic role assignment and partial goal planning, enabling flexible, collision-free navigation in complex scenarios. Formation stability and inter-robot safety are ensured through a virtual spring-damper system coupled with a novel obstacle avoidance layer that adaptively adjusts each agent's velocity. A dynamic look-ahead reference generator further enhances flexibility, allowing temporary formation deformation to maneuver around obstacles while maintaining goal-directed motion. The Fast Marching Square (FM2) algorithm provides the global path for the leader and local paths for the followers as the planning backbone. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with teams of quadruped robots. Results demonstrate smooth coordination, adaptive role switching, and robust formation maintenance in complex, unstructured environments.

Abstract: Pure Pursuit (PP) is widely used in autonomous racing for real-time path tracking due to its efficiency and geometric clarity, yet performance is highly sensitive to how key parameters-lookahead distance and steering gain-are chosen. Standard velocity-based schedules adjust these only approximately and often fail to transfer across tracks and speed profiles. We propose a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach that jointly chooses the lookahead Ld and a steering gain g online using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The policy observes compact state features (speed and curvature taps) and outputs (Ld, g) at each control step. Trained in F1TENTH Gym and deployed in a ROS 2 stack, the policy drives PP directly (with light smoothing) and requires no per-map retuning. Across simulation and real-car tests, the proposed RL-PP controller that jointly selects (Ld, g) consistently outperforms fixed-lookahead PP, velocity-scheduled adaptive PP, and an RL lookahead-only variant, and it also exceeds a kinematic MPC raceline tracker under our evaluated settings in lap time, path-tracking accuracy, and steering smoothness, demonstrating that policy-guided parameter tuning can reliably improve classical geometry-based control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning provides a framework for learning control policies that can reproduce diverse motions for simulated characters. However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm.

Abstract: Snapping beams enable rapid geometric transitions through nonlinear instability, offering an efficient means of generating motion in soft robotic systems. In this study, a tendon-driven mechanism consisting of spiral-based metabeams was developed to exploit this principle for producing both reciprocating and non-reciprocating motion. The snapping structures were fabricated using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) and experimentally tested under different boundary conditions to analyze their nonlinear behavior. The results show that the mechanical characteristics, including critical forces and stability, can be tuned solely by adjusting the boundary constraints. The spiral geometry allows large reversible deformation even when made from a relatively stiff material such as PLA, providing a straightforward design concept for controllable snapping behavior. The developed mechanism was further integrated into a swimming robot, where tendon-driven fins exhibited two distinct actuation modes: reciprocating and non-reciprocating motion. The latter enabled efficient propulsion, producing a forward displacement of about 32 mm per 0.4 s cycle ($\approx$ 81 mm/s, equivalent to 0.4 body lengths per second). This study highlights the potential of geometry-driven snapping structures for efficient and programmable actuation in soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Interactive perception (IP) enables robots to extract hidden information in their workspace and execute manipulation plans by physically interacting with objects and altering the state of the environment -- crucial for resolving occlusions and ambiguity in complex, partially observable scenarios. We present Zero-Shot IP (ZS-IP), a novel framework that couples multi-strategy manipulation (pushing and grasping) with a memory-driven Vision Language Model (VLM) to guide robotic interactions and resolve semantic queries. ZS-IP integrates three key components: (1) an Enhanced Observation (EO) module that augments the VLM's visual perception with both conventional keypoints and our proposed pushlines -- a novel 2D visual augmentation tailored to pushing actions, (2) a memory-guided action module that reinforces semantic reasoning through context lookup, and (3) a robotic controller that executes pushing, pulling, or grasping based on VLM output. Unlike grid-based augmentations optimized for pick-and-place, pushlines capture affordances for contact-rich actions, substantially improving pushing performance. We evaluate ZS-IP on a 7-DOF Franka Panda arm across diverse scenes with varying occlusions and task complexities. Our experiments demonstrate that ZS-IP outperforms passive and viewpoint-based perception techniques such as Mark-Based Visual Prompting (MOKA), particularly in pushing tasks, while preserving the integrity of non-target elements.

The device translates torsional deformation into measurable capacitance changes, enabling proprioceptive feedback for soft robotic systems. Using dissolvable-core molding, we fabricated a monolithic silicone structure with embedded conductive TPU electrodes, forming an integrated soft capacitor. Mechanical characterization revealed low stiffness and minimal impedance, with torque values below 0.01 N mm for axial displacements between -15 mm and 15 mm, and up to 0.03 N mm at 30 degrees twist under compression. Finite-element simulations confirmed localized stresses along fold lines and validated the measured torque-rotation response. Electrical tests showed consistent capacitance modulation up to 30%, directly correlated with the twist angle, and maximal sensitivity of S_theta ~ 0.0067 pF/deg at 5 mm of axial deformation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various embodied AI tasks. While deploying VLA models on real-world robots imposes strict real-time inference constraints, the inference performance landscape of VLA remains poorly understood due to the large combinatorial space of model architectures and inference systems. In this paper, we ask a fundamental research question: How should we design future VLA models and systems to support real-time inference? To address this question, we first introduce VLA-Perf, an analytical performance model that can analyze inference performance for arbitrary combinations of VLA models and inference systems. Using VLA-Perf, we conduct the first systematic study of the VLA inference performance landscape. From a model-design perspective, we examine how inference performance is affected by model scaling, model architectural choices, long-context video inputs, asynchronous inference, and dual-system model pipelines. From the deployment perspective, we analyze where VLA inference should be executed -- on-device, on edge servers, or in the cloud -- and how hardware capability and network performance jointly determine end-to-end latency. By distilling 15 key takeaways from our comprehensive evaluation, we hope this work can provide practical guidance for the design of future VLA models and inference systems.

Abstract: Snapping instabilities in soft structures offer a powerful pathway to achieve rapid and energy-efficient actuation. In this study, an eccentric dome-shaped snapping actuator is developed to generate controllable asymmetric motion through geometry-induced instability. Finite element simulations and experiments reveal consistent asymmetric deformation and the corresponding pressure characteristics. By coupling four snapping actuators in a pneumatic network, a compact quadrupedal robot achieves coordinated wavelike locomotion using only a single pressure input. The robot exhibits frequency-dependent performance with a maximum speed of 72.78~mm/s at 7.5~Hz. These findings demonstrate the potential of asymmetric snapping mechanisms for physically controlled actuation and lay the groundwork for fully untethered and efficient soft robotic systems.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a "locked-in" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.

Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models is increasingly challenging as models improve. Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks. Overall, our work suggests new paradigms for evaluating reasoning that cannot be saturated by design, and that allow testing models for other skills like creativity and task creation alongside problem solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate scientific workflows, yet their integration with heterogeneous computational tools remains ad hoc and fragile. Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gráfico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs.

Abstract: Traditional AI alignment primarily focuses on individual model outputs; however, autonomous agents in long-horizon workflows require sustained reliability across entire interaction trajectories. We introduce APEMO (Affect-aware Peak-End Modulation for Orchestration), a runtime scheduling layer that optimizes computational allocation under fixed budgets by operationalizing temporal-affective signals. Instead of modifying model weights, APEMO detects trajectory instability through behavioral proxies and targets repairs at critical segments, such as peak moments and endings. Evaluation across multi-agent simulations and LLM-based planner--executor flows demonstrates that APEMO consistently enhances trajectory-level quality and reuse probability over structural orchestrators. Our results reframe alignment as a temporal control problem, offering a resilient engineering pathway for the development of long-horizon agentic systems.

Abstract: LLM-based systems increasingly generate structured workflows for complex tasks. In practice, automatic evaluation of these workflows is difficult, because metric scores are often not calibrated, and score changes do not directly communicate the severity of workflow degradation. We introduce WorkflowPerturb, a controlled benchmark for studying workflow evaluation metrics. It works by applying realistic, controlled perturbations to golden workflows. WorkflowPerturb contains 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants across three perturbation types (Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes), each applied at severity levels of 10%, 30%, and 50%. We benchmark multiple metric families and analyze their sensitivity and calibration using expected score trajectories and residuals. Our results characterize systematic differences across metric families and support severity-aware interpretation of workflow evaluation scores. Our dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform. In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised representations are widely assumed to be neutral with respect to sensitive attributes when those attributes are withheld from training. We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines. We have made the code available at~ https://github.com/JosephBingham/SOMtime

Abstract: Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a prominent framework for efficient agent coordination. Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \underline{O}nline off-policy \underline{MA}RL framework using \underline{D}iffusion policies (\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination. Extensive evaluations on MPE and MAMuJoCo establish our method as the new state-of-the-art across $10$ diverse tasks, demonstrating a remarkable $2.5\times$ to $5\times$ improvement in sample efficiency.

Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) benchmarks are an established standard for measuring Vision Language Model (VLM) performance in driving tasks. However, we observe the known phenomenon that synthetically generated MCQAs are highly susceptible to hidden textual cues that allow models to exploit linguistic patterns rather than visual context. Our results show that a VLM fine-tuned on such data can achieve accuracy comparable to human-validated benchmarks even without visual input. Our proposed method reduces blind accuracy from +66.9% above random to +2.9%, eliminating the vast majority of exploitable textual shortcuts. By decoupling the correct answer from linguistic artifacts and employing a curriculum learning strategy, we force the model to rely on visual grounding, ensuring that performance accurately reflects perceptual understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box manufacturing processes, but its performance is often limited when dealing with high-dimensional multi-stage systems, where we can observe intermediate outputs. Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability. The fast optimization directly translates to substantial savings in time and resources. This highlights the importance of combining expert knowledge with structured probabilistic models for rapid process maturation.

Abstract: Existing Protein Language Models (PLMs) often suffer from limited adaptability to multiple tasks and exhibit poor generalization across diverse biological contexts. In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the capability to interpret protein sequences and fall short in domain-specific knowledge, limiting their capacity for effective biosemantic reasoning. To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB. It also achieves results on par with LLMs on general understanding tasks like MMLU and RACE. This showcases its innovative advantage of combining domain-specific adaptability with general-purpose language competency.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used approach for reducing the memory and compute costs of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools. Experiments show consistent improvements in average accuracy for MX low-bit quantization over strong baselines on a wide range of zero-shot benchmarks, across multiple model sizes.

Abstract: Consistency-based generative models like Shortcut and MeanFlow achieve impressive results via a target-aware design for solving the Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE). Typically, such methods introduce a target time $r$ alongside the current time $t$ to modulate outputs between a local multi-step derivative ($r = t$) and a global few-step integral ($r = 0$). However, the conventional "one input, one output" paradigm enforces a partition of the training budget, often allocating a significant portion (e.g., 75% in MeanFlow) solely to the multi-step objective for stability. This separation forces a trade-off: allocating sufficient samples to the multi-step objective leaves the few-step generation undertrained, which harms convergence and limits scalability. To this end, we propose Duality Models (DuMo) via a "one input, dual output" paradigm. Using a shared backbone with dual heads, DuMo simultaneously predicts velocity $v_t$ and flow-map $u_t$ from a single input $x_t$. This applies geometric constraints from the multi-step objective to every sample, bounding the few-step estimation without separating training objectives, thereby significantly improving stability and efficiency. On ImageNet 256 $\times$ 256, a 679M Diffusion Transformer with SD-VAE achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) FID of 1.79 in just 2 steps. Code is available at: https://github.com/LINs-lab/DuMo

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of vegetation dynamics is a key enabler for data-driven decision support in precision agriculture. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven recent progress in code large language models by leveraging execution-based feedback from unit tests, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the availability and reliability of high-quality test cases. We propose CodeScaler, an execution-free reward model designed to scale both reinforcement learning training and test-time inference for code generation. CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency. Moreover, CodeScaler surpasses existing reward models on RM-Bench not only in the code domain (+3.3 points), but also in general and reasoning domains (+2.7 points on average).

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of multi target active debris removal (ADR) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by introducing a unified coelliptic maneuver framework that combines Hohmann transfers, safety ellipse proximity operations, and explicit refueling logic. We benchmark three distinct planning algorithms Greedy heuristic, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and deep reinforcement learning (RL) using Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a realistic orbital simulation environment featuring randomized debris fields, keep out zones, and delta V constraints. Experimental results over 100 test scenarios demonstrate that Masked PPO achieves superior mission efficiency and computational performance, visiting up to twice as many debris as Greedy and significantly outperforming MCTS in runtime. These findings underscore the promise of modern RL methods for scalable, safe, and resource efficient space mission planning, paving the way for future advancements in ADR autonomy.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models show strong potential for joint reasoning over medical images and clinical text, but their performance often degrades under domain shift caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition protocols, and reporting styles. Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive code generation, enabling global planning and iterative refinement of complex program logic. However, existing approaches fail to respect the rigid structure of programming languages and, as a result, often produce broken programs that fail to execute. To address this, we introduce AnchorTree, a framework that explicitly anchors the diffusion process using structured, hierarchical priors native to code. Specifically, AnchorTree uses the abstract syntax tree to prioritize resolving syntactically and semantically salient tokens, such as keywords (e.g., if, while) and identifiers (e.g., variable names), thereby establishing a structural scaffold that guides the remaining generation. We validate this framework via AnCoder, a family of models showing that structurally anchored diffusion offers a parameter-efficient path to high-quality code generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{agentic unlearning} which removes specified information from both model parameters and persistent memory in agents with closed-loop interaction. Existing unlearning methods target parameters alone, leaving two critical gaps: (i) parameter-memory backflow, where retrieval reactivates parametric remnants or memory artifacts reintroduce sensitive content, and (ii) the absence of a unified strategy that covers both parameter and memory pathways. We present Synchronized Backflow Unlearning (SBU), a framework that unlearns jointly across parameter and memory pathways. The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts. The parameter pathway employs stochastic reference alignment to guide model outputs toward a high-entropy prior. These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination. Experiments on medical QA benchmarks show that SBU reduces traces of targeted private information across both pathways with limited degradation on retained data.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial for efficient model deployment, yet its effectiveness on Ascend NPU remains under-explored compared to GPU architectures. This paper presents a case study of representative PTQ baselines applied to reasoning-oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B/7B/14B) and QwQ-32B. We evaluate four distinct algorithms, including AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, and FlatQuant, to cover the spectrum from weight-only compression to advanced rotation-based methods. Our empirical results reveal significant platform sensitivity. While 4-bit weight-only quantization proves viable for larger models, aggressive 4-bit weight-activation schemes suffer from layer-wise calibration instability on the NPU, leading to logic collapse in long-context reasoning tasks. Conversely, standard 8-bit quantization remains numerically stable. Furthermore, a real-world INT8 deployment demonstrates that although optimized kernels reduce latency, dynamic quantization overheads currently limit end-to-end acceleration. These findings offer a practical reference for the feasibility and limitations of deploying quantized reasoning models on Ascend NPU.

Abstract: This work formulates and solves optimization problems to generate input points that yield high errors between a neural network's predicted AC power flow solution and solutions to the AC power flow equations. We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$Δ$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.

Abstract: Achieving personalized alignment requires adapting large language models to each user's evolving context. While decoding-time personalization offers a scalable alternative to training-time methods, existing methods largely rely on implicit, less interpretable preference representations and impose a rigid, context-agnostic user representation, failing to account for how preferences shift across prompts. We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences. Extensive experiments on human-annotated preference datasets demonstrate that EXACT consistently outperforms strong baselines, including preference modeling accuracy and personalized generation quality.

Abstract: Real physical systems are dissipative -- a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat -- and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the \emph{position-only} (q-only) problem: given only generalized positions~$q_t$ at discrete times (momenta~$p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a)~produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b)~recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided. The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x}=(J-R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt\le 0$ when $R\succeq 0$. We introduce \textbf{PHAST} (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential~$V(q)$, mass~$M(q)$, and damping~$D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting. Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often assumed to contain ``safety regions'' -- parameter subsets whose modification directly influences safety behaviors. We conduct a systematic evaluation of four safety region identification methods spanning different parameter granularities, from individual weights to entire Transformer layers, across four families of backbone LLMs with varying sizes. Using ten safety identification datasets, we find that the identified safety regions exhibit only low to moderate overlap, as measured by IoU. The overlap drops significantly when the safety regions are further refined using utility datasets (\ie non-harmful queries). These results suggest that current techniques fail to reliably identify a stable, dataset-agnostic safety region.

Abstract: Post-training weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory and inference cost of large language models (LLMs), yet pushing the average precision below 4 bits remains challenging due to highly non-uniform weight sensitivity and the lack of principled precision allocation. Existing solutions use irregular fine-grained mixed-precision with high runtime overhead or rely on heuristics or highly constrained precision allocation strategies. In this work, we propose ScaleBITS, a mixed-precision quantization framework that enables automated, fine-grained bitwidth allocation under a memory budget while preserving hardware efficiency. Guided by a new sensitivity analysis, we introduce a hardware-aligned, block-wise weight partitioning scheme, powered by bi-directional channel reordering. We formulate global bitwidth allocation as a constrained optimization problem and develop a scalable approximation to the greedy algorithm, enabling end-to-end principled allocation. Experiments show that ScaleBITS significantly improves over uniform-precision quantization (up to +36%) and outperforms state-of-the-art sensitivity-aware baselines (up to +13%) in ultra-low-bit regime, without adding runtime overhead.

Abstract: Real-time schedulers must reason about tight deadlines under strict compute budgets. We present TempoNet, a reinforcement learning scheduler that pairs a permutation-invariant Transformer with a deep Q-approximation. An Urgency Tokenizer discretizes temporal slack into learnable embeddings, stabilizing value learning and capturing deadline proximity. A latency-aware sparse attention stack with blockwise top-k selection and locality-sensitive chunking enables global reasoning over unordered task sets with near-linear scaling and sub-millisecond inference. A multicore mapping layer converts contextualized Q-scores into processor assignments through masked-greedy selection or differentiable matching. Extensive evaluations on industrial mixed-criticality traces and large multiprocessor settings show consistent gains in deadline fulfillment over analytic schedulers and neural baselines, together with improved optimization stability. Diagnostics include sensitivity analyses for slack quantization, attention-driven policy interpretation, hardware-in-the-loop and kernel micro-benchmarks, and robustness under stress with simple runtime mitigations; we also report sample-efficiency benefits from behavioral-cloning pretraining and compatibility with an actor-critic variant without altering the inference pipeline. These results establish a practical framework for Transformer-based decision making in high-throughput real-time scheduling.

Abstract: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides efficient, gradient-based methods for automatically designing neural networks, yet its adoption remains limited in practice. We present MIDAS, a novel approach that modernizes DARTS by replacing static architecture parameters with dynamic, input-specific parameters computed via self-attention. To improve robustness, MIDAS (i) localizes the architecture selection by computing it separately for each spatial patch of the activation map, and (ii) introduces a parameter-free, topology-aware search space that models node connectivity and simplifies selecting the two incoming edges per node. We evaluate MIDAS on the DARTS, NAS-Bench-201, and RDARTS search spaces. In DARTS, it reaches 97.42% top-1 on CIFAR-10 and 83.38% on CIFAR-100. In NAS-Bench-201, it consistently finds globally optimal architectures. In RDARTS, it sets the state of the art on two of four search spaces on CIFAR-10. We further analyze why MIDAS works, showing that patchwise attention improves discrimination among candidate operations, and the resulting input-specific parameter distributions are class-aware and predominantly unimodal, providing reliable guidance for decoding.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss poses a significant threat to humanity, making wildlife monitoring essential for assessing ecosystem health. Avian species are ideal subjects for this due to their popularity and the ease of identifying them through their distinctive songs. Traditionalavian monitoring methods require manual counting and are therefore costly and inefficient. In passive acoustic monitoring, soundscapes are recorded over long periods of time. The recordings are analyzed to identify bird species afterwards. Machine learning methods have greatly expedited this process in a wide range of species and environments, however, existing solutions require complex models and substantial computational resources. Instead, we propose running machine learning models on inexpensive microcontroller units (MCUs) directly in the field. Due to the resulting hardware and energy constraints, efficient artificial intelligence (AI) architecture is required. In this paper, we present our method for avian monitoring on MCUs. We trained and compressed models for various numbers of target classes to assess the detection of multiple bird species on edge devices and evaluate the influence of the number of species on the compressibility of neural networks. Our results demonstrate significant compression rates with minimal performance loss. We also provide benchmarking results for different hardware platforms and evaluate the feasibility of deploying energy-autonomous devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial computational demands raise concerns about the energy efficiency and sustainability of both training and inference. Inference, in particular, dominates total compute usage, making its optimization crucial. Recent research has explored optimization techniques and analyzed how configuration choices influence energy consumption. Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements. Overall, this work opens a new research direction that bridges software engineering and machine learning by leveraging variability modeling for the efficient and sustainable configuration of LLMs.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Proposition. Let $f$ be a predictor trained on a distribution $P$ and evaluated on a shifted distribution $Q$. Under verifiable regularity and complexity constraints, the excess risk under shift admits an explicit upper bound determined by a computable shift metric and model parameters. We develop a unified framework in which (i) risk under distribution shift is certified by explicit inequalities, (ii) verification of learned models is sound for nontrivial sizes, and (iii) interpretability is enforced through identifiability conditions rather than post hoc explanations. All claims are stated with explicit assumptions. Failure modes are isolated. Non-certifiable regimes are characterized.

Abstract: Developing foundation models for time series classification is of high practical relevance, as such models can serve as universal feature extractors for diverse downstream tasks. Although early models such as Mantis have shown the promise of this approach, a substantial performance gap remained between frozen and fine-tuned encoders. In this work, we introduce methods that significantly strengthen zero-shot feature extraction for time series. First, we introduce Mantis+, a variant of Mantis pre-trained entirely on synthetic time series. Second, through controlled ablation studies, we refine the architecture and obtain MantisV2, an improved and more lightweight encoder. Third, we propose an enhanced test-time methodology that leverages intermediate-layer representations and refines output-token aggregation. In addition, we show that performance can be further improved via self-ensembling and cross-model embedding fusion. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benchmarks, and EEG datasets show that MantisV2 and Mantis+ consistently outperform prior time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Modeling long-range dependencies in time series generation poses a fundamental trade-off between representational capacity and computational efficiency. Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss. We further derive a rigorous Heteroscedastic Loss to handle the non-isotropic noise distribution on the compressed manifold. Extensive experiments show that PaCoDi outperforms existing baselines in both generation quality and inference speed, offering a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient solution for time series modeling.

Abstract: Large language models adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates. Current theoretical explanations for this capability assume test tasks are drawn from a distribution similar to that seen during pretraining. This assumption overlooks adversarial distribution shifts that threaten real-world reliability. To address this gap, we introduce a distributionally robust meta-learning framework that provides worst-case performance guarantees for ICL under Wasserstein-based distribution shifts. Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($ρ$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($ρ_{\text{max}} \propto \sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_ρ- N_0 \propto ρ^2$). Experiments on synthetic tasks confirm these scaling laws. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of ICL's limits under adversarial conditions and suggest that model capacity serves as a fundamental resource for distributional robustness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly transformed medical prognostics by enabling rapid and accurate analysis across imaging and pathology. However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.

Abstract: Multi-turn interaction length is a dominant factor in the operational costs of conversational LLMs. In this work, we present a new failure mode in conversational LLMs: turn amplification, in which a model consistently prolongs multi-turn interactions without completing the underlying task. We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant. We also show that existing defenses offer limited protection against this emerging class of failures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from high sample complexity in sparse or delayed reward settings due to limited prior structure. Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning. However, heavy reliance on LLM supervision introduces scalability constraints and dependence on potentially unreliable signals. We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

Abstract: Stochastic Optimal Control provides a unified mathematical framework for solving complex decision-making problems, encompassing paradigms such as maximum entropy reinforcement learning(RL) and imitation learning(IL). However, conventional parametric policies often struggle to represent the multi-modality of the solutions. Though diffusion-based policies are aimed at recovering the multi-modality, they lack an explicit probability density, which complicates policy-gradient optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models. MePoly provides an explicit, tractable probability density, enabling exact entropy maximization. Theoretically, we ground our method in the classical moment problem, leveraging the universal approximation capabilities for arbitrary distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate that MePoly effectively captures complex non-convex manifolds and outperforms baselines in performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used for topology optimization (TO). However, most existing ML-based approaches focus on simplified benchmark problems due to their high computational cost, spectral bias, and difficulty in handling complex physics. These limitations become more pronounced in multi-material, multi-physics problems whose objective or constraint functions are not self-adjoint. To address these challenges, we propose a framework based on physics-informed Gaussian processes (PIGPs). In our approach, the primary, adjoint, and design variables are represented by independent GP priors whose mean functions are parametrized via neural networks whose architectures are particularly beneficial for surrogate modeling of PDE solutions. We estimate all parameters of our model simultaneously by minimizing a loss that is based on the objective function, multi-physics potential energy functionals, and design-constraints. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework on benchmark TO problems such as compliance minimization, heat conduction optimization, and compliant mechanism design under single- and multi-material settings. Additionally, we leverage thermo-mechanical TO with single- and multi-material options as a representative multi-physics problem. We also introduce differentiation and integration schemes that dramatically accelerate the training process. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PIGP framework can effectively solve coupled multi-physics and design problems simultaneously -- generating super-resolution topologies with sharp interfaces and physically interpretable material distributions. We validate these results using open-source codes and the commercial software package COMSOL.

Abstract: In environments with sparse or delayed rewards, reinforcement learning (RL) incurs high sample complexity due to the large number of interactions needed for learning. This limitation has motivated the use of large language models (LLMs) for subgoal discovery and trajectory guidance. While LLMs can support exploration, frequent reliance on LLM calls raises concerns about scalability and reliability. We address these challenges by constructing a memory graph that encodes subgoals and trajectories from both LLM guidance and the agent's own successful rollouts. From this graph, we derive a utility function that evaluates how closely the agent's trajectories align with prior successful strategies. This utility shapes the advantage function, providing the critic with additional guidance without altering the reward. Our method relies primarily on offline input and only occasional online queries, avoiding dependence on continuous LLM supervision. Preliminary experiments in benchmark environments show improved sample efficiency and faster early learning compared to baseline RL methods, with final returns comparable to methods that require frequent LLM interaction.

Abstract: Whole-brain biological neural networks naturally support the learning and control of whole-body movements. However, the use of brain connectomes as neural network controllers in embodied reinforcement learning remains unexplored. We investigate using the exact neural architecture of an adult fruit fly's brain for the control of its body movement. We develop Fly-connectomic Graph Model (FlyGM), whose static structure is identical to the complete connectome of an adult Drosophila for whole-body locomotion control. To perform dynamical control, FlyGM represents the static connectome as a directed message-passing graph to impose a biologically grounded information flow from sensory inputs to motor outputs. Integrated with a biomechanical fruit fly model, our method achieves stable control across diverse locomotion tasks without task-specific architectural tuning. To verify the structural advantages of the connectome-based model, we compare it against a degree-preserving rewired graph, a random graph, and multilayer perceptrons, showing that FlyGM yields higher sample efficiency and superior performance. This work demonstrates that static brain connectomes can be transformed to instantiate effective neural policy for embodied learning of movement control.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models rely on learned routers to assign tokens to experts, yet standard softmax gating provides no principled mechanism to control the tradeoff between sparsity and utilization. We propose Grassmannian MoE (GrMoE), a routing framework that operates on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces, where gating weights arise from the concentration parameters of Matrix Bingham distributions. This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $Λ$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse. We formally prove tight bounds relating the Bingham concentration spectrum to routing entropy, expected top-$k$ mass, and an exponential bound on expert collapse, establishing the first formal theory of concentration-controlled sparsity. On synthetic routing tasks, a 350M-parameter MoE language model with 8 experts, a 1.3B-parameter model with 16 experts, and a 2.7B-parameter model with 32 experts, GrMoE achieves 0\% routing collapse across all seeds, comparable or better perplexity with 15--30\% improved load balance, and a smooth monotonic relationship between concentration and effective sparsity that enables post-hoc sparsity tuning without retraining. Token-level analysis reveals that experts learn heterogeneous concentration values that correlate with linguistic specialization, providing interpretable routing behavior.

Abstract: Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA enable practical adaptation of large language models but provide no principled uncertainty estimates, leading to poorly calibrated predictions and unreliable behavior under domain shift. We introduce Stiefel-Bayes Adapters (SBA), a Bayesian PEFT framework that places a Matrix Langevin prior over orthonormal adapter factors on the Stiefel manifold $\St$ and performs approximate posterior inference via tangent space Laplace approximation with geodesic retraction. Unlike Gaussian priors in flat space projected onto orthogonality constraints, our prior on the manifold naturally encodes the inductive bias that adapter subspaces should be well conditioned and orthogonal, while the posterior provides calibrated predictive uncertainty without recalibration. We prove formally that the tangent space approximation strictly avoids the structural variance inflation inherent in projecting from ambient space, establishing a rigorous theoretical advantage for intrinsic manifold inference. Across GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks on RoBERTa-large, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B, domain shift evaluations, selective prediction protocols, and an abstractive summarization task, SBA achieves task performance comparable to LoRA and DoRA while reducing Expected Calibration Error by 18 to 34\% over deterministic baselines, improving selective prediction AUROC by 12 to 25\% under domain shift, and outperforming deep ensembles of five LoRA models on OOD detection at a fraction of the parameter cost. Our results demonstrate that where you place uncertainty, on the right geometric structure, matters more than simply adding any Bayesian treatment to adapters.

Abstract: Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a flexible family of amortized samplers trained to generate discrete and compositional objects with probability proportional to a reward function. However, learning efficiency is constrained by the model's ability to rapidly explore diverse high-probability regions during training. To mitigate this issue, recent works have focused on incentivizing the exploration of unvisited and valuable states via curiosity-driven search and self-supervised random network distillation, which tend to waste samples on already well-approximated regions of the state space. In this context, we propose Adaptive Complementary Exploration (ACE), a principled algorithm for the effective exploration of novel and high-probability regions when learning GFlowNets. To achieve this, ACE introduces an exploration GFlowNet explicitly trained to search for high-reward states in regions underexplored by the canonical GFlowNet, which learns to sample from the target distribution. Through extensive experiments, we show that ACE significantly improves upon prior work in terms of approximation accuracy to the target distribution and discovery rate of diverse high-reward states.

Abstract: Inferring causal relations in timeseries data with delayed effects is a fundamental challenge, especially when the underlying system exhibits complex dynamics that cannot be captured by simple functional mappings. Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.

Abstract: In active sequential testing, also termed pure exploration, a learner is tasked with the goal to adaptively acquire information so as to identify an unknown ground-truth hypothesis with as few queries as possible. This problem, originally studied by Chernoff in 1959, has several applications: classical formulations include Best-Arm Identification (BAI) in bandits, where actions index hypotheses, and generalized search problems, where strategically chosen queries reveal partial information about a hidden label. In many modern settings, however, the hypothesis space is continuous and naturally coincides with the query/action space: for example, identifying an optimal action in a continuous-armed bandit, localizing an $ε$-ball contained in a target region, or estimating the minimizer of an unknown function from a sequence of observations. In this work, we study pure exploration in such continuous spaces and introduce Continuous In-Context Pure Exploration for this regime. We introduce C-ICPE-TS, an algorithm that meta-trains deep neural policies to map observation histories to (i) the next continuous query action and (ii) a predicted hypothesis, thereby learning transferable sequential testing strategies directly from data. At inference time, C-ICPE-TS actively gathers evidence on previously unseen tasks and infers the true hypothesis without parameter updates or explicit hand-crafted information models. We validate C-ICPE-TS across a range of benchmarks, spanning continuous best-arm identification, region localization, and function minimizer identification.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies critically on selecting training data that most benefits a model's downstream performance. Gradient-based data selection methods such as TracIn and Influence Functions leverage influence to identify useful samples, but their computational cost scales poorly, making them impractical for multi-billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). A common alternative is to use off-the-shelf smaller models as proxies, but they remain suboptimal since their learning dynamics are unclear, their sizes cannot be flexibly adjusted, and they cannot be further aligned with the target model in terms of gradient-based influence estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce Iprox, a two-stage framework that derives influence-preserving proxies directly from the target model. It first applies a low-rank compression stage to preserve influence information of the target model, and then an aligning stage to align both model gradients and logits, thereby constructing proxies that flexibly control computational cost while retaining the target model's influence. Experimental results across diverse LLM families and evaluation tasks show that Iprox consistently outperforms off-the-shelf proxies and baseline methods. On Qwen3-4B, a 1.5B proxy constructed with Iprox achieves stronger performance than the larger 1.7B off-the-shelf proxy. Notably, on Llama3.2, Iprox achieves better performance than baselines while reducing computational cost by more than half relative to the full 3B model. These results show that Iprox provides effective influence-preserving proxies, making gradient-based data selection more scalable for LLMs.

Abstract: The paradigm of decision-making has been revolutionised by reinforcement learning and deep learning. Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods. Through evaluation on reinforcement learning benchmarks and synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed in this thesis in real-world decision making.

Abstract: Diffusion models generate high-quality samples but can also memorize training data, raising serious privacy concerns. Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.

Abstract: Understanding what features are encoded by learned directions in LLM activation space requires identifying inputs that strongly activate them. Feature visualization, which optimizes inputs to maximally activate a target direction, offers an alternative to costly dataset search approaches, but remains underexplored for LLMs due to the discrete nature of text. Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes. We evaluate on Sparse Autoencoder latents from Gemma 2 2B, proposing metrics grounded in dataset activation statistics to enable rigorous comparison, and show that ADAPT consistently outperforms prior methods across layers and latent types. Our results establish that feature visualization for LLMs is tractable, but requires design assumptions tailored to the domain.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on parallelization and collective operations, which are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using e.g., Huffman codes can alleviate the issue, however, Huffman codes suffer from slow, bit-sequential decoding and high hardware complexity due to deep tree traversals. Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Dual Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. Analyzing BFloat16 tensors from the Gemma model, we observed that the top 8 most frequent symbols account for approximately 50% of the cumulative probability. These 8 symbols are assigned a short 4 bit code. The remaining 248 symbols are assigned a longer 9 bit code. The coding scheme uses a single prefix bit to distinguish between the two code lengths. The scheme uses a small Look Up Table with only 8 entries for encoding and decoding. The scheme achieves a compressibility of 18.6% in comparison to 21.3% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.

Abstract: Mechanistic models encode scientific knowledge about dynamical systems and are widely used in downstream scientific and policy applications. Recent work has explored LLM-based agentic frameworks to automatically construct mechanistic models from data; however, existing problem settings substantially oversimplify real-world conditions, leaving it unclear whether LLM-generated mechanistic models are reliable in practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling (NIMM) evaluation framework, which evaluates LLM-generated mechanistic models under realistic settings with partial observations and diversified task objectives. Our evaluation reveals fundamental challenges in current baselines, ranging from model effectiveness to code-level correctness. Motivated by these findings, we design NIMMgen, an agentic framework for neural-integrated mechanistic modeling that enhances code correctness and practical validity through iterative refinement. Experiments across three datasets from diversified scientific domains demonstrate its strong performance. We also show that the learned mechanistic models support counterfactual intervention simulation.

Abstract: Class imbalance induces systematic bias in deep neural networks by imposing a skewed effective class prior. This work introduces the Neural Prior Estimator (NPE), a framework that learns feature-conditioned log-prior estimates from latent representations. NPE employs one or more Prior Estimation Modules trained jointly with the backbone via a one-way logistic loss. Under the Neural Collapse regime, NPE is analytically shown to recover the class log-prior up to an additive constant, providing a theoretically grounded adaptive signal without requiring explicit class counts or distribution-specific hyperparameters. The learned estimate is incorporated into logit adjustment, forming NPE-LA, a principled mechanism for bias-aware prediction. Experiments on long-tailed CIFAR and imbalanced semantic segmentation benchmarks (STARE, ADE20K) demonstrate consistent improvements, particularly for underrepresented classes. NPE thus offers a lightweight and theoretically justified approach to learned prior estimation and imbalance-aware prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are two key steps in the post-training of modern Language Models (LMs). A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.

Abstract: The dataset distributions in offline reinforcement learning (RL) often exhibit complex and multi-modal distributions, necessitating expressive policies to capture such distributions beyond widely-used Gaussian policies. To handle such complex and multi-modal datasets, in this paper, we propose Flow Actor-Critic, a new actor-critic method for offline RL, based on recent flow policies. The proposed method not only uses the flow model for actor as in previous flow policies but also exploits the expressive flow model for conservative critic acquisition to prevent Q-value explosion in out-of-data regions. To this end, we propose a new form of critic regularizer based on the flow behavior proxy model obtained as a byproduct of flow-based actor design. Leveraging the flow model in this joint way, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance for test datasets of offline RL including the D4RL and recent OGBench benchmarks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitors are LLM-based systems that analyze reasoning traces to detect when outputs may exhibit attributes of interest, such as test-hacking behavior during code generation. In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs. Across multiple different environments, we show both methods significantly improve monitor accuracy while preventing CoT degeneration even when training against a monitor, thereby mitigating reward hacking when the task reward is imperfectly specified.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) generate text token-by-token, requiring n forward passes to produce a sequence of length n. Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for "imposing" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable practical success of transformer-based language models, recent work has raised concerns about their ability to perform state tracking. In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.

Abstract: This paper presents a direct framework for sequence models with hidden states on closed subgroups of U(d). We use a minimal axiomatic setup and derive recurrent and transformer templates from a shared skeleton in which subgroup choice acts as a drop-in replacement for state space, tangent projection, and update map. We then specialize to O(d) and evaluate orthogonal-state RNN and transformer models on Tiny Shakespeare and Penn Treebank under parameter-matched settings. We also report a general linear-mixing extension in tangent space, which applies across subgroup choices and improves finite-budget performance in the current O(d) experiments.

Abstract: Attention-based regression models are often trained by jointly optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) loss, emphasizing the magnitude of errors and the order or shape of targets, respectively. A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.

Abstract: We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $μ$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $μ$ is \emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.

Abstract: Compressing neural networks without retraining is vital for deployment at scale. We study calibration-free compression through the lens of projection geometry: structured pruning is an axis-aligned projection, whereas model folding performs a low-rank projection via weight clustering. We formalize both as orthogonal operators and show that, within a rank distance of one, folding provably yields smaller parameter reconstruction error, and under mild smoothness assumptions, smaller functional perturbations than pruning. At scale, we evaluate >1000 checkpoints spanning ResNet18, PreActResNet18, ViT-B/32, and CLIP ViT-B/32 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, covering diverse training hyperparameters (optimizers, learning rates, augmentations, regularization, sharpness-aware training), as well as multiple LLaMA-family 60M and 130M parameter models trained on C4. We show that folding typically achieves higher post-compression accuracy, with the largest gains at moderate-high compression. The gap narrows and occasionally reverses at specific training setups. Our results position folding as a geometry-aware, calibration-free alternative to pruning that is often superior in practice and principled in theory.

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, motivating their adoption as expressive policies in reinforcement learning (RL). While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL. FINO facilitates effective exploration by injecting noise into policy training, thereby encouraging a broader range of actions beyond those observed in the offline dataset. In addition to exploration-enhanced flow policy training, we combine an entropy-guided sampling mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the policy to adapt its behavior throughout online fine-tuning. Experiments across diverse, challenging tasks demonstrate that FINO consistently achieves superior performance under limited online budgets.

Abstract: Autonomous (noise-agnostic) generative models, such as Equilibrium Matching and blind diffusion, challenge the standard paradigm by learning a single, time-invariant vector field that operates without explicit noise-level conditioning. While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\text{marg}}(\mathbf{u}) = -\log p(\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\mathbf{u}) = \int p(\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.

Abstract: We study an algorithm-independent, worst-case lower bound for the Gaussian process (GP) bandit problem in the frequentist setting, where the reward function is fixed and has a bounded norm in the known reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Specifically, we focus on the squared exponential (SE) kernel, one of the most widely used kernel functions in GP bandits. One of the remaining open questions for this problem is the gap in the \emph{dimension-dependent} logarithmic factors between upper and lower bounds. This paper partially resolves this open question under a hyperspherical input domain. We show that any algorithm suffers $Ω(\sqrt{T (\ln T)^{d} (\ln \ln T)^{-d}})$ cumulative regret, where $T$ and $d$ represent the total number of steps and the dimension of the hyperspherical domain, respectively. Regarding the simple regret, we show that any algorithm requires $Ω(ε^{-2}(\ln \frac{1}ε)^d (\ln \ln \frac{1}ε)^{-d})$ time steps to find an $ε$-optimal point. We also provide the improved $O((\ln T)^{d+1}(\ln \ln T)^{-d})$ upper bound on the maximum information gain for the SE kernel. Our results guarantee the optimality of the existing best algorithm up to \emph{dimension-independent} logarithmic factors under a hyperspherical input domain.

Abstract: Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization (HPO) have emerged recently, leveraging bilevel programming techniques to optimize hyperparameter by estimating hypergradient w.r.t. validation loss. Nevertheless, previous theoretical works mainly focus on reducing the gap between the estimation and ground-truth (i.e., the bias), while ignoring the error due to data distribution (i.e., the variance), which degrades performance. To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation. To explain the improved performance, we establish a connection between excess error and hypergradient estimation, offering some understanding of empirical observations.

Abstract: AI evaluation has primarily focused on measuring capabilities, with formal approaches inspired from Item Response Theory (IRT) being increasingly applied. Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an "ideal band". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.

Abstract: The trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness is a pervasive phenomenon in deep learning, yet its geometric origin remains elusive. In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off. SBDE expands input images by inserting constant-valued pixels, which breaks translational symmetry and consistently improves clean accuracy (e.g., from $90.47\%$ to $95.63\%$ on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18) by reducing parameter degeneracy. However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions. The projection effectively neutralizes the attacks and restores robustness, revealing that the model achieves high accuracy by creating \emph{sharp boundaries} (steep loss gradients) specifically along the auxiliary axes. Our findings provide a concrete geometric explanation for the accuracy-robustness paradox: the optimization landscape deepens the basin of attraction to improve accuracy but inevitably erects steep walls along the auxiliary degrees of freedom, creating a fragile sensitivity to off-manifold perturbations.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters brain electrophysiology and disrupts multichannel EEG dynamics, making accurate and clinically useful EEG-based diagnosis increasingly important for screening and disease monitoring. However, many existing approaches rely on black-box classifiers and do not explicitly model the underlying dynamics that generate observed signals. To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations. LERD combines a continuous-time event inference module with a stochastic event-generation process to capture flexible temporal patterns, while incorporating an electrophysiology-inspired dynamical prior to guide learning in a principled way. We further provide theoretical analysis that yields a tractable bound for training and stability guarantees for the inferred relational dynamics. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and two real-world AD EEG cohorts demonstrate that LERD consistently outperforms strong baselines and yields physiology-aligned latent summaries that help characterize group-level dynamical differences.

Abstract: One-dimensional function approximation is a fundamental problem in scientific computing and engineering applications. While neural networks possess powerful universal approximation capabilities, their optimization process is often hindered by flat loss landscapes induced by parameter-space symmetries, leading to slow convergence and poor generalization, particularly for high-frequency components. Inspired by the principle of \emph{symmetry breaking} in physics, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly approach for function approximation through \emph{input-space expansion}. The core idea involves augmenting the original one-dimensional input (e.g., $x$) with constant values (e.g., $π$) to form a higher-dimensional vector (e.g., $[π, π, x, π, π]$), effectively breaking parameter symmetries without increasing the network's parameter count. We evaluate the method on ten representative one-dimensional functions, including smooth, discontinuous, high-frequency, and non-differentiable functions. Experimental results demonstrate that input-space expansion significantly accelerates training convergence (reducing LBFGS iterations by 12\% on average) and enhances approximation accuracy (reducing final MSE by 66.3\% for the optimal 5D expansion). Ablation studies further reveal the effects of different expansion dimensions and constant selections, with $π$ consistently outperforming other constants. Our work proposes a low-cost, efficient, and hardware-friendly technique for algorithm design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in multi-agent negotiation tasks, yet evaluation in this domain remains challenging due to a lack of robust and generalizable benchmarks. Abdelnabi et al. (2024) introduce a negotiation benchmark based on Scoreable Games, with the aim of developing a highly complex and realistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Our work investigates the reproducibility of claims in their benchmark, and provides a deeper understanding of its usability and generalizability. We replicate the original experiments on additional models, and introduce additional metrics to verify negotiation quality and evenness of evaluation. Our findings reveal that while the benchmark is indeed complex, model comparison is ambiguous, raising questions about its objectivity. Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users. Our results highlight the importance of context in model-comparative evaluations.

Abstract: Online model selection in Bayesian bandits raises a fundamental exploration challenge: When an environment instance is sampled from a prior distribution, how can we design an adaptive strategy that explores multiple bandit learners and competes with the best one in hindsight? We address this problem by introducing a new Bayesian algorithm for online model selection in stochastic bandits. We prove an oracle-style guarantee of $O\left( d^* M \sqrt{T} + \sqrt{(MT)} \right)$ on the Bayesian regret, where $M$ is the number of base learners, $d^*$ is the regret coefficient of the optimal base learner, and $T$ is the time horizon. We also validate our method empirically across a range of stochastic bandit settings, demonstrating performance that is competitive with the best base learner. Additionally, we study the effect of sharing data among base learners and its role in mitigating prior mis-specification.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often fail to be generalized across cohorts because underlying data distributions differ by clinical site, region, demographics, and measurement protocols. This limitation is particularly pronounced in hip fracture risk prediction, where the performance of models trained on one cohort (the source cohort) can degrade substantially when deployed in other cohorts (target cohorts). We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences. Unlike existing methods that rely heavily on supervised tuning or assume known outcomes of samples in target cohorts, our outcome-free approaches enable the model selection under realistic deployment conditions and improve generalization of models in hip fracture risk prediction.

Abstract: School congestion, where student enrollment exceeds school capacity, is a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint. Our work demonstrates that subsidy programs alone cannot resolve systemic overcrowding, and computational modeling can empower education policymakers to make equitable, data-driven decisions by revealing the structural constraints that shape effective resource allocation, even when resources are limited.

Abstract: Decoding sits between a language model and everything we do with it, yet it is still treated as a heuristic knob-tuning exercise. We argue decoding should be understood as a principled optimisation layer: at each token, we solve a regularised problem over the probability simplex that trades off model score against structural preferences and constraints. This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore. We demonstrate this by designing Best-of-K (BoK), a KL-anchored coverage objective aimed at multi-sample pipelines (self-consistency, reranking, verifier selection). BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance. We show that such samples can improve accuracy by, for example, +18.6% for Qwen2.5-Math-7B on MATH500 at high sampling temperatures.

Abstract: Machine learning is at the heart of managing the real-world problems associated with massive data. With the success of neural networks on such large-scale problems, more research in machine learning is being conducted now than ever before. This dissertation focuses on three different projects rooted in mathematical theory for machine learning applications.
  The first project deals with supervised learning and manifold learning. In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\mathcal{D}=\{(x_j,f(x_j))\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.
  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.
  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems. We introduce theory to unify signal separation with classification and a new algorithm which yields competitive accuracy to other recent active learning algorithms while providing results much faster.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC), have expanded the residual connection paradigm by introducing wider residual streams and diverse connectivity patterns. While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines. As a flexible and scalable extension of HC, JPmHC advances spectrum-aware, stable, and efficient deep learning, offering insights into topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise, commonly observed in transformer models, can destabilize the optimization process. Recent works mainly focus on developing and understanding approaches to address heavy-tailed noise in the centralized or distributed, synchronous setting, leaving the interactions between such noise and asynchronous optimization underexplored. In this work, we investigate two communication schemes that handle stragglers with asynchronous updates in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise. We propose and theoretically analyze algorithmic modifications based on delay-aware learning rate scheduling and delay compensation to enhance the performance of asynchronous algorithms. Our convergence guarantees under heavy-tailed noise match the rate of the synchronous counterparts and improve delay tolerance compared with existing asynchronous approaches. Empirically, our approaches outperform prior synchronous and asynchronous methods in terms of accuracy/runtime trade-offs and are more robust to hyperparameters in both image and language tasks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, clients tend to have non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which often leads to client-drift, and therefore diminishing convergence speed and model performance. While adaptive optimizers have been proposed to mitigate these effects, they frequently introduce computational complexity or communication overhead unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. This paper introduces Federated Zero Mean Gradients (FedZMG), a novel, parameter-free, client-side optimization algorithm designed to tackle client-drift by structurally regularizing the optimization space. Advancing the idea of Gradient Centralization, FedZMG projects local gradients onto a zero-mean hyperplane, effectively neutralizing the "intensity" or "bias" shifts inherent in heterogeneous data distributions without requiring additional communication or hyperparameter tuning. A theoretical analysis is provided, proving that FedZMG reduces the effective gradient variance and guarantees tighter convergence bounds compared to standard FedAvg. Extensive empirical evaluations on EMNIST, CIFAR100, and Shakespeare datasets demonstrate that FedZMG achieves better convergence speed and final validation accuracy compared to the baseline FedAvg and the adaptive optimizer FedAdam, particularly in highly non-IID settings.

Abstract: Biological neural networks (like the hippocampus) can internally generate "replay" resembling stimulus-driven activity. Recent computational models of replay use noisy recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to path-integrate. Replay in these networks has been described as Langevin sampling, but new modifiers of noisy RNN replay have surpassed this description. We re-examine noisy RNN replay as sampling to understand or improve it in three ways: (1) Under simple assumptions, we prove that the gradients replay activity should follow are time-varying and difficult to estimate, but readily motivate the use of hidden state leakage in RNNs for replay. (2) We confirm that hidden state adaptation (negative feedback) encourages exploration in replay, but show that it incurs non-Markov sampling that also slows replay. (3) We propose the first model of temporally compressed replay in noisy path-integrating RNNs through hidden state momentum, connect it to underdamped Langevin sampling, and show that, together with adaptation, it counters slowness while maintaining exploration. We verify our findings via path-integration of 2D triangular and T-maze paths and of high-dimensional paths of synthetic rat place cell activity.

Abstract: The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.

Abstract: Dual-to-Dual MLLMs refer to Multimodal Large Language Models, which can enable unified multimodal comprehension and generation through text and image modalities. Although exhibiting strong instantaneous learning and generalization capabilities, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs still remain deficient in lifelong evolution, significantly affecting continual adaptation to dynamic real-world scenarios. One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer. However, no standardized continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs has been established yet, leaving these challenges unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we establish Continual-NExT, a continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs with deliberately-architected evaluation metrics. To improve the continual learning capability of Dual-to-Dual MLLMs, we propose an efficient MAGE (Mixture and Aggregation of General LoRA and Expert LoRA) method to further facilitate knowledge transfer across modalities and mitigate forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGE outperforms other continual learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for learning dynamical systems. These models directly encode physical principles into network architectures. However, systematic benchmarking of these approaches across diverse physical phenomena remains limited, particularly in conservative and dissipative systems. In addition, benchmarking that has been done thus far does not integrate out full trajectories to check stability. In this work, we benchmark three prominent physics-informed architectures such as Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN), Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNN), and Symplectic Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNN) using the DeepChem framework, an open-source scientific machine learning library. We evaluate these models on six dynamical systems spanning classical conservative mechanics (mass-spring system, simple pendulum, double pendulum, and three-body problem, spring-pendulum) and non-conservative systems with contact (bouncing ball). We evaluate models by computing error on predicted trajectories and evaluate error both quantitatively and qualitatively. We find that all benchmarked models struggle to maintain stability for chaotic or nonconservative systems. Our results suggest that more research is needed for physics-informed deep learning models to learn robust models of classical mechanical systems.

Abstract: Equivariance is central to graph generative models, as it ensures the model respects the permutation symmetry of graphs. However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\%$ of the baseline training epochs.

Abstract: We study online resource allocation under non-stationary demand with a minimum offline data requirement. In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.
  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation. Our framework advances prior work by operating with minimal offline data (one sample per period), handling arbitrary non-stationarity without variation-budget assumptions, and supporting multiple resource constraints.

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) is a biologically-inspired learning framework characterised by local, parallelisable operations, properties that enable energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Despite this, extending PC effectively to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been challenging, particularly for tasks involving long-range temporal dependencies. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) remains the dominant method for training RNNs, but its non-local computation, lack of spatial parallelism, and requirement to store extensive activation histories results in significant energy consumption. This work introduces a novel method combining Temporal Predictive Coding (tPC) with approximate Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL), enabling effective spatio-temporal credit assignment. Results indicate that the proposed method can closely match the performance of BPTT on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks. On a challenging machine translation task, with a 15-million parameter model, the proposed method achieves a test perplexity of 7.62 (vs. 7.49 for BPTT), marking one of the first applications of tPC to tasks of this scale. These findings demonstrate the potential of this method to learn complex temporal dependencies whilst retaining the local, parallelisable, and flexible properties of the original PC framework, paving the way for more energy-efficient learning systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to propagate information across long distances due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.

Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.

Abstract: Previous work has explored the computational complexity of deriving two fundamental types of explanations for ML model predictions: (1) *sufficient reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when fixed, determine a prediction, and (2) *contrastive reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when modified, alter a prediction. Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of blast wave propagation remains a longstanding challenge due to its highly nonlinear behavior, sharp gradients, and burdensome computational cost. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer fast inference as a promising alternative, they suffer from degraded accuracy, particularly evaluated on complex urban layouts or out-of-distribution scenarios. Moreover, autoregressive prediction strategies in such models are prone to error accumulation over long forecasting horizons, limiting their robustness for extended-time simulations. To address these limitations, we propose RGD-Blast, a robust and generalizable deep surrogate model for high-fidelity, long-term blast wave forecasting. RGD-Blast incorporates a multi-scale module to capture both global flow patterns and local boundary interactions, effectively mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive prediction. We introduce a dynamic-static feature coupling mechanism that fuses time-varying pressure fields with static source and layout features, thereby enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RGD-Blast achieves a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over traditional numerical methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. In generalization tests on unseen building layouts, the model achieves an average RMSE below 0.01 and an R2 exceeding 0.89 over 280 consecutive time steps. Additional evaluations under varying blast source locations and explosive charge weights further validate its generalization, substantially advancing the state of the art in long-term blast wave modeling.

Abstract: This work presents a new approach to decentralized training-SeedFlood-designed to scale for large models across complex network topologies and achieve global consensus with minimal communication overhead. Traditional gossip-based methods suffer from message communication costs that grow with model size, while information decay over network hops renders global consensus inefficient. SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients. Our experiments on decentralized LLM fine-tuning demonstrate thatSeedFlood consistently outperforms gossip-based baselines in both generalization performance and communication efficiency, and even achieves results comparable to first-order methods in large scale settings.

Abstract: Structured dilated attention has an appealing inference-time efficiency knob: it reduces the FLOPs of the attention and the KV cache size by a factor of the dilation size D, while preserving long-range connectivity. However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively. Moreover, RAT+ outperforms attention when sparsifying to the top-k block attention. We further scale to 2.6B parameters and 200B tokens and observe the same trend.

Abstract: Deep Generative models (DGMs) play two key roles in modern machine learning: (i) producing new information (e.g., image synthesis) and (ii) reducing dimensionality. However, traditional architectures often rely on auxiliary networks such as encoders in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which introduce training instability, computational overhead, and risks like mode collapse. We present NeuroSQL, a new generative paradigm that eliminates the need for auxiliary networks by learning low-dimensional latent representations implicitly. NeuroSQL leverages an asymptotic approximation that expresses the latent variables as the solution to an optimal transportation problem. Specifically, NeuroSQL learns the latent variables by solving a linear assignment problem and then passes the latent information to a standalone generator. We benchmark its performance against GANs, VAEs, and a budget-matched diffusion baseline on four datasets: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (CelebA), animal faces (AFHQ), and brain images (OASIS). Compared to VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models: (1) in terms of image quality, NeuroSQL achieves overall lower mean pixel distance between synthetic and authentic images and stronger perceptual/structural fidelity; (2) computationally, NeuroSQL requires the least training time; and (3) practically, NeuroSQL provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data with limited training samples. By embracing quantile assignment rather than an encoder, NeuroSQL provides a fast, stable, and robust way to generate synthetic data with minimal information loss.

Abstract: Accurate AC-PF prediction under domain shift is critical when models trained on medium-voltage (MV) grids are deployed on high-voltage (HV) networks. Existing physics-informed graph neural solvers typically rely on full fine-tuning for cross-regime transfer, incurring high retraining cost and offering limited control over the stability-plasticity trade-off between target-domain adaptation and source-domain retention. We study parameter-efficient domain adaptation for physics-informed self-attention based GNN, encouraging Kirchhoff-consistent behavior via a physics-based loss while restricting adaptation to low-rank updates. Specifically, we apply LoRA to attention projections with selective unfreezing of the prediction head to regulate adaptation capacity. This design yields a controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off for physics-constrained inverse estimation under voltage-regime shift. Across multiple grid topologies, the proposed LoRA+PHead adaptation recovers near-full fine-tuning accuracy with a target-domain RMSE gap of $2.6\times10^{-4}$ while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 85.46%. The physics-based residual remains comparable to full fine-tuning; however, relative to Full FT, LoRA+PHead reduces MV source retention by 4.7 percentage points (17.9% vs. 22.6%) under domain shift, while still enabling parameter-efficient and physically consistent AC-PF estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in solving PDEs, largely due to their ability to enable fast simulations once trained. However, despite the availability of high-performance computing infrastructure, many critical applications remain constrained by the substantial computational costs associated with generating large-scale, high-quality datasets and training models. In this work, inspired by studies on the structure of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, we introduce Neural-HSS, a parameter-efficient architecture built upon the Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix structure that is provably data-efficient for a broad class of PDEs. We theoretically analyze the proposed architecture, proving that it satisfies exactness properties even in very low-data regimes. We also investigate its connections with other architectural primitives, such as the Fourier neural operator layer and convolutional layers. We experimentally validate the data efficiency of Neural-HSS on the three-dimensional Poisson equation over a grid of two million points, demonstrating its superior ability to learn from data generated by elliptic PDEs in the low-data regime while outperforming baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate its capability to learn from data arising from a broad class of PDEs in diverse domains, including electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and biology.

Abstract: We propose a proof of concept for a variational distributional neuron: a compute unit formulated as a VAE brick, explicitly carrying a prior, an amortized posterior and a local ELBO. The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This "contraction" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze "collapse" modes and the conditions for a "living neuron", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.

Abstract: Data-efficient neural decoding is a central challenge for speech brain-computer interfaces. We present the first demonstration of transfer learning and cross-task decoding for MEG-based speech models spanning perception and production. We pre-train a Conformer-based model on 50 hours of single-subject listening data and fine-tune on just 5 minutes per subject across 18 participants. Transfer learning yields consistent improvements, with in-task accuracy gains of 1-4% and larger cross-task gains of up to 5-6%. Not only does pre-training improve performance within each task, but it also enables reliable cross-task decoding between perception and production. Critically, models trained on speech production decode passive listening above chance, confirming that learned representations reflect shared neural processes rather than task-specific motor activity.

Abstract: AutoClustering methods aim to automate unsupervised learning tasks, including algorithm selection (AS), hyperparameter optimization (HPO), and pipeline synthesis (PS), by often leveraging meta-learning over dataset meta-features. While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design. This study therefore offers a practical foundation for increasing decision transparency in unsupervised learning automation.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of main engine power is essential for vessel performance optimization, fuel efficiency, and compliance with emission regulations. Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones. The proposed framework provides a practical and computationally efficient tool for vessel performance monitoring, with applications in weather routing, trim optimization, and energy efficiency planning.

Abstract: Clustering is widely used for unsupervised structure discovery, yet it offers limited insight into how reliable each individual assignment is. Diagnostics, such as convergence behavior or objective values, may reflect global quality, but they do not indicate whether particular instances are assigned confidently, especially for initialization-sensitive algorithms like k-means. This assignment-level instability can undermine both accuracy and robustness. Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that CAKE effectively highlights ambiguous points and stable core members, providing a confidence ranking that can guide filtering or prioritization to improve clustering quality.
