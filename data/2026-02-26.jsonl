When individuals face disaster situations, they often experience confusion and lack the domain-specific knowledge and experience necessary to determine appropriate responses and actions. While disaster information is continuously updated, even when utilizing RAG search and large language models for inquiries, obtaining relevant domain knowledge about natural disasters and experiences similar to one's specific situation is not guaranteed. When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences. Utilizing the cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads architecture with LoRA efficiency optimization, we achieved 70.4\\% End Position accuracy with only 5.7\\% of the total parameters (6.7M/117M). Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of Japanese BERT-base optimization and Bi-LSTM contextual understanding achieves accuracy levels suitable for real disaster response scenarios, attaining a 0.885 Span F1 score. Future challenges include: establishing natural disaster Q\\&A benchmark datasets, fine-tuning foundation models with disaster knowledge, developing lightweight and power-efficient edge AI Disaster Q\\&A applications for situations with insufficient power and communication during disasters, and addressing disaster knowledge base updates and continual learning capabilities."}

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x."}

In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines. These results show that entity enrichment significantly improves domain adaptation and model generalization, enabling more accurate automated screening in systematic reviews."}

A fundamental challenge in these tasks is the uncertainties when operating in space, e.g., in measurements of satellites' states, which can make future states difficult to predict. Another challenge is that satellites' onboard processors are typically much slower than their terrestrial counterparts. Therefore, to address these challenges we propose to solve an ARPOD problem with feedback optimization, which computes inputs to a system by measuring its outputs, feeding them into an optimization algorithm in the loop, and computing some number of iterations towards an optimal input. We focus on satellite rendezvous, and satellites' dynamics are modeled using the continuous-time Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which are marginally stable. We develop an asymptotically stabilizing controller for them, and we use discrete-time gradient descent in the loop to compute inputs to them. Then, we analyze the hybrid feedback optimization system formed by the stabilized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with gradient descent in the loop. We show that this model is well-posed and that maximal solutions are both complete and non-Zeno. Then, we show that solutions converge exponentially fast to a ball around a rendezvous point, and we bound the radius of that ball in terms of system parameters. Simulations show that this approach provides up to a 98.4\\% reduction in the magnitude of disturbances across a range of simulations, which illustrates the viability of hybrid feedback optimization for autonomous satellite rendezvous."}

By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio."}

Synthetic data offers a practical substitute for downstream development, and large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful engines for generating it. However, existing private text generation methods are severely inefficient: they are data-intensive, computationally slow, and often require large private corpora or batch sizes to achieve usable quality. We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes. Furthermore, we enhance our method by utilizing pretrained (base) models and introducing fixed-shot prompting to boost generation diversity and fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that EPSVec outperforms existing baselines in distributional alignment and downstream utility, particularly in low-data regimes, while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

In our set-up, the sensor measurements are considered to be private and are jointly correlated with an underlying process. A fusion center combines the private sensor measurements and releases its output to an honest-but-curious party, which is responsible for estimating the state of the underlying process based on the fusion center's output. The privacy leakage incurred by the fusion policy is quantified using Rényi differential privacy. We formulate the privacy-aware fusion design as a constrained finite-horizon optimization problem, in which the fusion policy and the state estimation are jointly optimized to minimize the state estimation error subject to a total privacy budget constraint. We derive the constrained optimality conditions for the proposed optimization problem and use them to characterize the structural properties of the optimal fusion policy. Unlike classical differential privacy mechanisms, the optimal fusion policy is shown to adaptively allocates the privacy budget and regulates the adversary's belief in a closed-loop manner. To reduce the computational burden of solving the resulting constrained optimality equations, we parameterize the fusion policy using a structured Gaussian distribution and show that the parameterized fusion policy satisfies the privacy constraint. We further develop a numerical algorithm to jointly optimize the fusion policy and state estimator. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion framework through a traffic density estimation case study."}

ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution."}

While fusing inertial reading with satellite positioning in an extended Kalman filter provides short-term navigation continuity, low-cost inertial sensors suffer from rapid error accumulation during prolonged outages. Existing information aiding approaches, such as the non-holonomic constraint, impose rigid equality assumptions on vehicle motion that may be violated under dynamic urban driving conditions, limiting their robustness precisely when aiding is most needed. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch information aiding framework that fuses equality and inequality motion constraints through a variance-weighted scheme, requiring only a software modification to an existing navigation filter with no additional sensors or hardware. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available urban datasets featuring various inertial sensors, road conditions, and dynamics, covering a total duration of 4.3 hours of recorded data. Under Full GNSS availability, the method reduces vertical position error by 16.7% and improves altitude accuracy by 50.1% over the standard non-holonomic constraint. Under GNSS-denied conditions, vertical drift is reduced by 24.2% and altitude accuracy improves by 20.2%. These results demonstrate that replacing hard motion equality assumptions with physically motivated inequality bounds is a practical and cost-free strategy for improving navigation resilience, continuity, and drift robustness without relying on additional sensors, map data, or learned models."}

The methodology integrates a violation detection and quantification (VDQ) model to systematically identify system breaches, and a violation-mitigated BESS planning (VMBP) model for optimal BESS sitting and sizing. Specifically, Stage I of the DDCP framework diagnoses critical bottleneck lines that render standalone BESS solutions infeasible. Stage II targets cable upgrades exclusively at the Top-N prioritized bottleneck lines and Stage III then executes the optimal BESS deployment using a network-enhanced VMBP model. Furthermore, this study quantifies the EV hosting capacity thresholds before and after BESS integration across varying EV adoption rates and base voltages. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis evaluates four mitigation approaches: the VDQ-driven cable upgrade (VCU) model, the VMBP model, system-wide voltage uprating, and the proposed DDCP framework.

Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites."}

As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.\n  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive."}

To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model.

Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning.

Existing approaches rely on problem-specific approximations or penalty-based treatments. This letter presents a unified complementarity-based framework for soft-robot contact modeling and planning that brings contact modeling, manipulation, and planning into a unified, physically consistent formulation. We develop a robust Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) model tailored to discretized soft robots and address these challenges with a three-stage conditioning pipeline: inertial rank selection to remove redundant contacts, Ruiz equilibration to correct scale disparity and ill-conditioning, and lightweight Tikhonov regularization on normal blocks. Building on the same formulation, we introduce a kinematically guided warm-start strategy that enables dynamic trajectory optimization through contact using Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) and demonstrate its effectiveness on contact-rich ball manipulation tasks. In conclusion, CUSP provides a new foundation for unifying contact modeling, simulation, and planning in soft robotics."}

The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos.

In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension.

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau."}

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.\n  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference. Overall, MoMKD establishes a robust and generalizable knowledge distillation paradigm for computational pathology."}

Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering."}

Phrases like \"This is urgent\" or \"As your supervisor\" can shift model behavior without altering task content. We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems."}

Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space.

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space.

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures.

In these systems, agents can join or leave the network over time, and the interaction structure may evolve accordingly. To capture these dynamical structural changes, we represent the network as a switched system interconnected over a dynamic and directed signed graph. Additionally, the network may contain one or multiple leader groups that influence the behavior of the remaining agents. In general, we show that the OMAS exhibit a more general form of synchronization, including trivial consensus, bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol, and constructs strict Lyapunov functions for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues.

Leaderboards aggregate these comparisons into a single Bradley-Terry (BT) ranking, forcing heterogeneous preferences into a total order and violating basic social-choice desiderata. In contrast, social choice theory provides an alternative approach called maximal lotteries, which aggregates pairwise preferences without imposing any assumptions on their structure. However, we show that maximal lotteries are highly sensitive to preference heterogeneity and can favor models that severely underperform on specific tasks or user subpopulations. We introduce robust lotteries that optimize worst-case performance under plausible shifts in the preference data. On large-scale preference datasets, robust lotteries provide more reliable win rate guarantees across the annotator distribution and recover a stable set of top-performing models. By moving from rankings to pluralistic sets of winners, robust lotteries offer a principled step toward an ecosystem of complementary AI systems that serve the full spectrum of human preferences."}

Vehicles must maneuver safely near animals and fragile structures while coping with currents, variable illumination and limited sensing. Previous approaches simplify these problems by leveraging soft materials and bioinspired swimming designs, but such platforms remain limited in terms of deployable autonomy. Here we present a sea turtle-inspired autonomous underwater robot that closed the gap between bioinspired locomotion and field-ready autonomy through a tightly integrated, vision-driven control stack. The robot combines robust depth-heading stabilization with obstacle avoidance and target-centric control, enabling it to track and interact with moving objects in complex terrain. We validate the robot in controlled pool experiments and in a live coral reef exhibit at the New England Aquarium, demonstrating stable operation and reliable tracking of fast-moving marine animals and human divers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated biomimetic robotic system, combining novel hardware, control, and field experiments, deployed to track and monitor real marine animals in their natural environment. During off-tether experiments, we demonstrate safe navigation around obstacles (91\\% success rate in the aquarium exhibit) and introduce a low-compute onboard tracking mode. Together, these results establish a practical route toward soft-rigid hybrid, bioinspired underwater robots capable of minimally disruptive exploration and close-range monitoring in sensitive ecosystems."}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems."}

By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that progressive scheduling is a reliable compute-reduction strategy across model families, with curriculum-specific benefits contingent on the interaction between model capacity and task complexity."}

However, acquiring accurate CSI a priori is notoriously challenging due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a pilot-free framework for optimal control over wireless channels in which control commands are generated from plant states together with control-aided channel prediction. For linear plants operating over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture, channel prediction is performed via a Kalman filter (KF), and the optimal control policy is derived from the Bellman principle. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in computing the optimal control policy, we approximate the solution using a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), which can be computed efficiently via a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm. Rigorous performance guarantees are established by proving the stability of both the channel predictor and the closed-loop system under the resulting control policy, providing sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing approximate CARE solution, and establishing convergence of the SA-based control algorithm. The framework is further extended to nonlinear plants under general wireless architectures by combining a KalmanNet-based predictor with a Markov-modulated deep deterministic policy gradient (MM-DDPG) controller. Numerical results show that the proposed pilot-free approach outperforms benchmark schemes in both control performance and channel prediction accuracy for linear and nonlinear scenarios."}

Unlike conventional approaches that continuously stream raw inertial data to a microcontroller for classification, the proposed system executes activity recognition at the sensor level using the embedded Machine Learning Core (MLC) of the STMicroelectronics LSM6DSV16X IMU, allowing the host microcontroller to remain in a low-power state and read only the recognized activity label from IMU registers. While the system generalizes to multiple human activities, this paper focuses on three representative locomotion modes - stance, level walking, and stair ascent - using data collected from adult participants. A lightweight decision-tree model was configured and deployed for on-sensor execution using ST MEMS Studio, enabling continuous operation without custom machine learning code on the microcontroller. During operation, the IMU asserts an interrupt when motion or a new classification is detected; the microcontroller wakes, reads the MLC output registers, and forwards the inferred mode to the exoskeleton controller. This interrupt-driven, on-sensor inference architecture reduces computation and communication overhead while preserving battery energy and improving robustness in distinguishing level walking from stair ascent for torque-assist control."}

However, the effect and choice of the execution horizon - the number of actions to be executed from each predicted chunk - remains underexplored. In this work, we first show that varying the execution horizon leads to substantial performance deviations, with performance initially improving and then declining as the horizon increases. To uncover the reasons, we analyze the cross- and self-attention weights in flow-based VLAs and reveal two key phenomena: (i) intra-chunk actions attend invariantly to vision-language tokens, limiting adaptability to environmental changes; and (ii) the initial and terminal action tokens serve as stable anchors, forming latent centers around which intermediate actions are organized. Motivated by these insights, we interpret action self-attention weights as a proxy for the model's predictive limit and propose AutoHorizon, the first test-time method that dynamically estimates the execution horizon for each predicted action chunk to adapt to changing perceptual conditions. Across simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, AutoHorizon is performant, incurs negligible computational overhead, and generalizes across diverse tasks and flow-based models."}

While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making."}

Our approach generalizes our previous work (Rezende et al., 2022) and reduces to it when considering the Lie group of translations in Euclidean space. Since the proofs in Rezende et al. (2022) rely on key properties such as the orthogonality between the convergent and traversal components, we extend these results by leveraging Lie group properties. These properties also allow the control input to be non-redundant, meaning it matches the dimension of the Lie group, rather than the potentially larger dimension of the space in which the group is embedded. This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field. We experimentally validate the proposed method using a robotic manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness."}

However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain.

We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models. These results demonstrate that enhancing implicit reasoning capabilities can significantly improve complex instruction following. This project will be open-sourced in the near future."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting.

To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long.

To address these gaps, we introduce TRACE (Trajectory-Aware Comprehensive Evaluation), a framework that holistically assesses the entire problem-solving trajectory. To counter the \"high-score illusion\", we propose a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function that quantifies process efficiency and cognitive quality, including evidence grounding, alongside accuracy. To measure deeper attributes, TRACE introduces a Scaffolded Capability Assessment protocol, quantifying an agent's latent ability by determining the minimum guidance needed for success. Our contributions include the TRACE framework, its novel metrics, and the accompanying DeepResearch-Bench with controllable complexity. Experiments show TRACE delivers a granular ranking that uncovers critical trade-offs between agent accuracy, efficiency, and robustness entirely missed by singular metrics."}

With the ongoing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and increasing vehicle connectivity, the integration of traffic information has become crucial for improving both energy efficiency and thermal comfort in modern vehicles. To enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes a novel traffic-aware hierarchical integrated thermal and energy management (TA-ITEM) strategy for connected HEVs. In the upper layer, global reference trajectories for battery state of charge (SOC) and cabin temperature are planned using traffic flow speed information obtained from ITSs. In the lower layer, a real-time model predictive control (MPC)-based ITEM controller is developed, which incorporates a novel Transformer-based speed predictor with driving condition recognition (TF-DCR) to enable anticipatory tracking of the reference trajectories. Numerical simulations are conducted under various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed TA-ITEM approach outperforms conventional rule-based and MPC-SP approaches, with average fuel consumption reductions of 56.36\\% and 5.84\\%, respectively, while maintaining superior thermal regulation and cabin comfort. These findings confirm the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of TA-ITEM and underscore the advantages of incorporating traffic information."}

However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing. Numerical experiments demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method."}

To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance.

By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control.

How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety."}

To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. % as part of the prompt. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety."}

The tempering exponent is treated as a hyperparameter whose influence is examined with respect to distributional accuracy compared with Monte Carlo simulations.

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation."}

We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments."}

The HiPPO framework, originally proposed by Gu & Dao et al., provides a principled approach to sequential compression by projecting signals onto orthogonal polynomial (OP) bases via structured linear ordinary differential equations. Subsequent works have embedded these dynamics in state space models (SSMs), where HiPPO structure serves as an initialization. Nonlinear successors of these SSM methods such as Mamba are state-of-the-art for many tasks with long-range dependencies, but the mechanisms by which they represent and prioritize history remain largely implicit. In this work, we revisit the HiPPO framework with the goal of making these mechanisms explicit. We show how polynomial representations of history can be extended to support capabilities of modern SSMs such as adaptive allocation of memory and associative memory while retaining direct interpretability in the OP basis. We introduce a unified framework comprising five such extensions, which we collectively refer to as a \"HiPPO zoo.\" Each extension exposes a specific modeling capability through an explicit, interpretable modification of the HiPPO framework. The resulting models adapt their memory online and train in streaming settings with efficient updates. We illustrate the behaviors and modeling advantages of these extensions through a range of synthetic sequence modeling tasks, demonstrating that capabilities typically associated with modern SSMs can be realized through explicit, interpretable polynomial memory structures."}

A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric."}

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x."}

However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple safety and utility benchmarks show that our method consistently improves alignment robustness while maintaining overall model utility."}

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity."}

Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions."}

To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Dynamic Modality Diffusion Policy (ADM-DP), a framework that integrates vision, tactile, and graph-based (multi-agent pose) modalities for coordinated control. ADM-DP introduces four key innovations. First, an enhanced visual encoder merges RGB and point-cloud features via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation to enrich perception. Second, a tactile-guided grasping strategy uses Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR) feedback to detect insufficient contact and trigger corrective grasp refinement, improving grasp stability. Third, a graph-based collision encoder leverages shared tool center point (TCP) positions of multiple agents as structured kinematic context to maintain spatial awareness and reduce inter-agent interference. Fourth, an Adaptive Modality Attention Mechanism (AMAM) dynamically re-weights modalities according to task context, enabling flexible fusion. For scalability and modularity, a decoupled training paradigm is employed in which agents learn independent policies while sharing spatial information. This maintains low interdependence between agents while retaining collective awareness. Across seven multi-agent tasks, ADM-DP achieves 12-25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies show the greatest improvements in tasks requiring multiple sensory modalities, validating our adaptive fusion strategy and demonstrating its robustness for diverse manipulation scenarios."}

This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings. Our work provides a robust and generalizable solution for learning 3D object detectors with minimal or no manual annotations."}

In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines.

This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field. We experimentally validate the proposed method using a robotic manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness."}

Current tactile simulations suffer from a persistent dilemma: simplified geometric projections lack physical authenticity, while high-fidelity Finite Element Methods (FEM) are too computationally prohibitive for large-scale reinforcement learning. In this work, we present Tacmap, a high-fidelity, computationally efficient tactile simulation framework anchored in volumetric penetration depth. Our key insight is to bridge the tactile sim-to-real gap by unifying both domains through a shared deform map representation. Specifically, we compute 3D intersection volumes as depth maps in simulation, while in the real world, we employ an automated data-collection rig to learn a robust mapping from raw tactile images to ground-truth depth maps. By aligning simulation and real-world in this unified geometric space, Tacmap minimizes domain shift while maintaining physical consistency. Quantitative evaluations across diverse contact scenarios demonstrate that Tacmap's deform maps closely mirror real-world measurements. Moreover, we validate the utility of Tacmap through an in-hand rotation task, where a policy trained exclusively in simulation achieves zero-shot transfer to a physical robot."}

However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to \"think with images\" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training."}

Both vector representations can be used as a drop-in replacement for dictionary- and subtoken-based word embeddings in existing model architectures. It has the potential to improve performance for both large context-based language models like BERT and small models like word2vec for under-resourced and morphologically rich languages.

To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%.

This becomes problematic for multi-step reasoning, where correct answers depend on aggregating evidence from multiple parts of the context and composing latent token-to-token relations over a chain of intermediate inferences. To address this, we propose Interleaved Head Attention (IHA), which enables cross-head mixing by constructing $P$ pseudo-heads per head (typically $P=H$), where each pseudo query/key/value is a learned linear combination of all $H$ original queries, keys and values respectively. Interactions between pseudo-query and pseudo-key heads induce up to $P^2$ attention patterns per head with modest parameter overhead $\\mathcal{O}(H^2P)$.

However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination.

We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes.

This study proposes a Gait Divergence Analysis Framework (GDAF), a unified biomechanical evaluation framework that systematically quantifies kinematic and kinetic discrepancies between humans and bipedal robots. We apply GDAF to systematically compare human and humanoid locomotion across 28 walking speeds. To enable reproducible analysis, we collect and release a speed-continuous humanoid locomotion dataset from a state-of-the-art humanoid controller. We further provide an open-source implementation of GDAF, including analysis, visualization, and MuJoCo-based tools, enabling quantitative, interpretable, and reproducible biomechanical analysis of humanoid locomotion. Results demonstrate that despite visually human-like motion generated by modern humanoid controllers, significant biomechanical divergence persists across speeds. Robots exhibit systematic deviations in gait symmetry, energy distribution, and joint coordination, indicating that substantial room remains for improving the biomechanical fidelity and energetic efficiency of humanoid locomotion. This work provides a quantitative benchmark for evaluating humanoid locomotion and offers data and versatile tools to support the development of more human-like and energetically efficient locomotion controllers.

In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings.

In this work, we investigate how accurately large language models (LLMs) represent African American Vernacular English (AAVE). We analyze three LLMs to compare their usage of AAVE to the usage of humans who natively speak AAVE. We first analyzed interviews from the Corpus of Regional African American Language and TwitterAAE to identify the typical contexts where people use AAVE grammatical features such as ain't. We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE. Furthermore, through sentiment analysis and manual inspection, we found that the models replicated stereotypes about African Americans. These results highlight the need for more diversity in training data and the incorporation of fairness methods to mitigate the perpetuation of stereotypes."}

We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy.

To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

In this paper, we propose SunnyParking, a novel dual-branch E2E architecture that achieves motion state awareness by jointly predicting spatial trajectories and discrete motion state sequences (e.g., forward/reverse).

To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity.

To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks. Our work demonstrates that explicit mode-level decoupling enables both robust multi-modal modeling and reactive closed-loop control for robotic manipulation."}

While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive.

A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines."}

We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments."}

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding."}

However, relying solely on outcome supervision risks reward hacking, where models learn spurious reasoning patterns to satisfy final answer checks.

In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning.

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework.

At high speeds and small angles of attack, their dynamics exhibit strong coupling between lift and attitude, resembling fixed-wing aircraft behavior. At low speeds or large angles of attack, viscous effects and flow separation dominate, leading to drag-driven and damping-dominated dynamics. Accurately representing transitions between these regimes remains a fundamental challenge. This paper presents a hybrid aerodynamic modeling framework that integrates a fixed-wing Aerodynamic Coupling Model (ACM) and a Generalized Drag Model (GDM) using a learned neural network mixer with explicit physics-based regularization. The mixer enables smooth transitions between regimes while retaining explicit, physics-based aerodynamic representation. Model parameters are identified through a structured three-phase pipeline tailored for hybrid aerodynamic modeling. The proposed approach is validated on the RGBlimp platform through a large-scale experimental campaign comprising 1,320 real-world flight trajectories across 330 thruster and moving mass configurations, spanning a wide range of speeds and angles of attack. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model consistently outperforms single-model and predefined-mixer baselines, establishing a practical and robust aerodynamic modeling solution for winged blimps."}

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines."}

To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering.

Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance."}

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations."}

Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks.

To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate that SEFMAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a Speech-guided Machine Translation (SMT) framework that integrates speech and text as fused inputs into an MLLM to improve translation quality. To mitigate reliance on low-resource data, we introduce a Self-Evolution Mechanism. The core components of this framework include a text-to-speech model, responsible for generating synthetic speech, and an MLLM capable of classifying synthetic speech samples and iteratively optimizing itself using positive samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses all existing methods on the Multi30K multimodal machine translation benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, on general machine translation datasets, particularly the FLORES-200, it achieves average state-of-the-art performance in 108 translation directions.

Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants."}

We present JALA, a pretraining framework that learns Jointly-Aligned Latent Actions. JALA bypasses full visual dynamic reconstruction, instead learns a predictive action embedding aligned with both inverse dynamics and real actions. This yields a transition-aware, behavior-centric latent space for learning from heterogeneous human data.

The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost."}

While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making."}

We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48).

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity."}

The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms."}

We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models. These results demonstrate that enhancing implicit reasoning capabilities can significantly improve complex instruction following. This project will be open-sourced in the near future."}

Post-training sparsity (PTS), which reduces model cost by removing weights from dense networks, is an effective approach. However, native dense matrices lack high sparsity, making existing approaches that directly remove weights disrupt model states, resulting in unsatisfactory performance recovery even with post-tuning. We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead. At the feature level, we introduce Spectral Norm Loss to promote feature sparsity from a low-rank perspective. Experiments across diverse model architectures and tasks demonstrate that our method further enhances sparsity-friendliness, achieving superior pruning performance over existing approaches."}

To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality."}

In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%. The grasp policies with DexRep are deployed to the real world under multi-camera and single-camera setups and demonstrate a small sim-to-real gap."}

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%."}

ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution."}

Although existing cross-tokenizer KD methods have made notable progress, their effectiveness remains constrained by suboptimal alignment across sequence and vocabulary levels. To address these limitations, we introduce Dual-Space Weighting and Time-Warped Alignment (DWA-KD), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that enhances token-wise distillation through dual-space entropy-based weighting and achieves precise sequence-level alignment by leveraging both lexical and semantic information. At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences. Extensive experiments across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that DWA-KD outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of entropy-based token weighting and embedding and final hidden state layer Soft-DTW alignment."}

In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation.

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence."}

While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks."}

To address this, and considering the evolving capabilities of 5G/6G networks, we propose a novel SAR framework that includes Mission Planning and Mission Execution phases and that optimizes robot deployment. By considering parameters such as the exploration area size, terrain elevation, robot fleet size, communication-influenced energy profiles, desired exploration rate, and target response time, our framework determines the minimum number of robots required and their optimal paths to ensure effective coverage and timely data backhaul over mobile networks. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs between number of robots, explored area, and response time for wheeled and quadruped robots. Further, we quantify the impact of terrain elevation data on mission time and energy consumption, showing the benefits of incorporating real-world environmental factors that might also affect mobile signal propagation and connectivity into SAR planning.

Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs."}

A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts.

Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation.

In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion.

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau."}

However, recently \\citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$.

However, existing models overlook the heterogeneous and non-uniform organization of pathological regions of interest (ROIs) because they rely on natural image backbones not tailored for tissue morphology. Consequently, they often fail to capture the coherent tissue architecture beyond isolated patches, limiting interpretability and clinical relevance. To address these challenges, we present Cross-modal Adaptive Region Encoder (CARE), a foundation model for pathology that automatically partitions WSIs into several morphologically relevant regions. Specifically, CARE employs a two-stage pretraining strategy: (1) a self-supervised unimodal pretraining stage that learns morphological representations from 34,277 whole-slide images (WSIs) without segmentation annotations, and (2) a cross-modal alignment stage that leverages RNA and protein profiles to refine the construction and representation of adaptive regions. This molecular guidance enables CARE to identify biologically relevant patterns and generate irregular yet coherent tissue regions, selecting the most representative area as ROI. CARE supports a broad range of pathology-related tasks, using either the ROI feature or the slide-level feature obtained by aggregating adaptive regions. Based on only one-tenth of the pretraining data typically used by mainstream foundation models, CARE achieves superior average performance across 33 downstream benchmarks, including morphological classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis, and outperforms other foundation model baselines overall."}

Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability.

In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction.

In robot swarms, measurements from different robots arrive asynchronously and with clock time-offsets. Although Continuous-Time (CT) formulations have proved effective for handling asynchronous measurements in single-robot SLAM and calibration, extending CT methods to multi-robot settings faces great challenges to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency, and high-frequency performance. Especially, existing CT methods suffer from the inherent query-time delay of unclamped B-splines and high computational cost. This paper proposes CT-RIO, a novel Continuous-Time Relative-Inertial Odometry framework. We employ Clamped Non-Uniform B-splines (C-NUBS) to represent robot states for the first time, eliminating the query-time delay. We further augment C-NUBS with closed-form extension and shrinkage operations that preserve the spline shape, making it suitable for online estimation and enabling flexible knot management. This flexibility leads to the concept of knot-keyknot strategy, which supports spline extension at high-frequency while retaining sparse keyknots for adaptive relative-motion modeling. We then formulate a sliding-window relative localization problem that operates purely on relative kinematics and inter-robot constraints. To meet the demanding computation required at swarm scale, we decompose the tightly-coupled optimization into robot-wise sub-problems and solve them in parallel using incremental asynchronous block coordinate descent. Extensive experiments show that CT-RIO converges from time-offsets as large as 263 ms to sub-millisecond within 3 s, and achieves RMSEs of 0.046 m and 1.8 °.

Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency.

Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria.

Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies.

VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.\n  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.\n  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.\n  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models."}

While numerous studies have proposed memory recall systems, these primarily rely on deep learning techniques that require extensive training and often face data scarcity due to the limited availability of personal lifelogs. As lifelogs grow over time, systems must also adapt quickly to newly accumulated data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, making them promising for personalized applications. In this work, we present a framework that leverages LLMs for proactive information access, integrating personal knowledge graphs to enhance the detection of access needs through a refined decision-making process. Our framework offers high flexibility, enabling the replacement of base models and the modification of fact retrieval methods for continuous improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies forgotten events, supporting users in recalling past experiences more efficiently."}

Preliminary work", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios. The results demonstrate clearly that FlowCorrect learns only with very few demonstrations and enables fast and sample-efficient incremental, human-in-the-loop corrections of generative visuomotor policies at deployment time in real-world robotics."}

However, pretrained-based methods, which are based on end-to-end training and expected to generalize to all the potential samples, suffer from training data dependency. Implicit neural representation (INR) based methods are distribution-agnostic and more robust, but they require time-consuming online training and suffer from the bitstream overhead from the overfitted model. To address these limitations, we propose HybridINR-PCGC, a novel hybrid framework that bridges the pretrained model and INR. Our framework retains distribution-agnostic properties while leveraging a pretrained network to accelerate convergence and reduce model overhead, which consists of two parts: the Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) and the Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR). We leverage the PPN, designed for fast inference and stable performance, to generate a robust prior for accelerating the DAR's convergence. The DAR is decomposed into a base layer and an enhancement layer, and only the enhancement layer needed to be packed into the bitstream. Finally, we propose a supervised model compression module to further supervise and minimize the bitrate of the enhancement layer parameters. Based on experiment results, HybridINR-PCGC achieves a significantly improved compression rate and encoding efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 20.43% compared to G-PCC on 8iVFB. In the challenging out-of-distribution scenario Cat1B, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 57.85% compared to UniPCGC. And our method exhibits a superior time-rate trade-off, achieving an average Bpp reduction of 15.193% relative to the LINR-PCGC on 8iVFB."}

In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs."}

Existing learning-based policies often entangle these roles in a monolithic network, trading off global generalization against stable local refinement, while control-centric approaches typically assume a known task structure or learn only controller parameters rather than the structure itself. In this paper, we formalize a physically grounded interaction frame, an instantaneous local basis that decouples force regulation from motion execution, and propose a method to recover it from demonstrations. Based on this, we address both issues by proposing Force Policy, a global-local vision-force policy in which a global policy guides free-space actions using vision, and upon contact, a high-frequency local policy with force feedback estimates the interaction frame and executes hybrid force-position control for stable interaction. Real-world experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with more robust contact establishment, more accurate force regulation, and reliable generalization to novel objects with varied geometries and physical properties, ultimately improving both contact stability and execution quality.

Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures.

This challenge is especially acute in medical imaging, where models are fine-tuned locally at clinics on private data, producing domain-specific models that differ by scanner, protocol, and population. When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios. These performance gains are achieved while retaining single-model inference at test-time, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks."}

To address this, we introduce E-comIQ-ZH, a framework for evaluating Chinese e-commerce posters. We build the first dataset E-comIQ-18k to feature multi dimensional scores and expert calibrated Chain of Thought (CoT) rationales. Using this dataset, we train E-comIQ-M, a specialized evaluation model that aligns with human expert judgment. Our framework enables E-comIQ-Bench, the first automated and scalable benchmark for the generation of Chinese e-commerce posters. Extensive experiments show our E-comIQ-M aligns more closely with expert standards and enables scalable automated assessment of e-commerce posters. All datasets, models, and evaluation tools will be released to support future research in this area.Code will be available at https://github.com/4mm7/E-comIQ-ZH."}

Models produce ranges far wider than true confidence intervals yet still fail to contain the true algorithmic mean in the majority of instances; most perform worse than random guessing and the marginal above-random performance of the best model is most consistent with benchmark memorization rather than principled reasoning.

Simulations with a collective of 50 agents demonstrate that the position-based flocking model attains faster and more sustained directional alignment and results in more compact formations than a velocity-alignment-based baseline.

For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion."}

Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above.

While top models often match or even outperform human experts on DDx generation, all MLLMs exhibit a much larger DDx--FDx performance gap compared to expert clinicians, indicating a failure mode in synthesis of heterogeneous CE types.

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning."}

Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction."}

Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads.

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework.

We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models."}

Experiments on a synthetic 2D grid and real-world molecule-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to baselines that require additional training."}

A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data. These findings indicate that large datasets for deep learning-based stand delineations can be assembled using projects including temporally aligned ALS data and DAP point clouds."}

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations."}

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function.

To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.\n  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity."}

We show a steep drop in ToM capabilities under task perturbation for all evaluated LLMs, questioning the notion of any robust form of ToM being present.

We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $κ_φ(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits.

Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability. However, our preliminary analyses reveal that artifact features exhibit high intra-feature similarity, leading to an almost uniform attention map after the softmax operation. This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features. Experiments on standard AIGI detection benchmarks upon several advanced MLLMs, show that our TranX-Adapter brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +6% accuracy)."}

To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality."}

Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations."}

Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment. Our models are trained with the Muon optimizer and evaluated on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including zero-shot abnormality and organ classification, segmentation, and retrieval tasks."}

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA.

Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting.

The boundary net maps material parameters to the latent space co-shared by its image counterpart. Because such a setup is dimensionally wise ill-posed, we further couple BD net with deep clustering. To access the performance of our proposed method, we simulate an IC chip dataset comprising of 1825 stress images. We compare our new approach using variants of BD net as well as a baseline approach. We show that our approach is able to outperform all the comparison in terms of train and test error reduction."}

Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks."}

Preliminary work", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows. In practice, models often struggle to keep attention aligned with the most relevant context throughout decoding. In this work, we propose DySCO, a novel decoding algorithm for improving long-context reasoning. DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute. Further analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic attention rescaling and retrieval-head-guided selection for the effectiveness of the method, while providing interpretability insights into decoding-time attention behavior.

In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online."}

Unlike these methods, we propose LiREC-Net, a target-free, learning-based calibration network that jointly calibrates multiple sensor modality pairs, including LiDAR, RGB, and event data, within a unified framework. To reduce redundant computation and improve efficiency, we introduce a shared LiDAR representation that leverages features from both its 3D nature and projected depth map, ensuring better consistency across modalities.

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks."}

Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality.

To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long.

However, it challenges tasks requiring high precision, such as the point-prompted instance segmentation (PPIS) task, which aims to estimate precise masks using single-point prompts to train a segmentation network. Due to the constraints of point annotations, granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty arise the difficulty distinguishing between different levels of detail (eg. whole object vs. parts) and the challenge of precisely delineating object boundaries. Previous works have usually inherited the paradigm of mask generation along with proposal selection to achieve PPIS. However, proposal selection relies solely on category information, failing to resolve the ambiguity of different granularity. Furthermore, mask generators offer only finite discrete solutions that often deviate from actual masks, particularly at boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet). It integrates Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to tackle group and local issues caused by the point's granularity ambiguity. Additionally, we incorporate completeness scores within proposals to add spatial granularity awareness, enhancing multiple instance learning (MIL) in proposal selection termed S-MIL. The Multi-level Affinity Refinement conveys pixel and semantic clues, narrowing boundary uncertainty during mask refinement. These modules culminate in SAPNet++, mitigating point prompt's granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty and significantly improving segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, highlighting the potential to advance PPIS."}

Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs."}

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts.

By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio."}

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF."}

Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications.

However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution.

We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation.

However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance."}

Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion.

We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804).

Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods."}

To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient.

To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information.

To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition.

Unlike ray tracing, which requires full 3D reconstruction, LGI captures essential light-shadow interactions reliably and accurately, computed from off-the-shelf 2.5D depth map predictions. LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning. To enable effective training, we curated the first large-scale benchmark dataset for joint shadow and relighting, covering reflections, transparency, and complex interreflections. Experiments show significant gains in realism and consistency across synthetic and real images. LGI thus bridges geometry-inspired rendering with generative modeling, enabling efficient, physically consistent shadow generation and relighting."}

Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists. However, the absence of interactive tools seamlessly embedded within diagnostic routines impedes collaboration, while the semantic gap between radiologists' decision-making patterns and model representations further limits clinical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem."}

When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy.

Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation."}

As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence."}

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients.

Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios."}

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence."}

Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.\n  This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.\n  To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified."}

Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost."}

While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., \"emphasize facial expression,\" \"bring the subject forward\"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators."}

We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data."}

These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and validate our approach on extensive simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset."}

Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness.

FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts.

In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands.

To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries.

We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us impose simple spectral structure, perform structured variational inference in a low-dimensional weight space, and calculate exact layer spectral norms, enabling inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds and margin-based robustness diagnostics. By placing independent complex Gaussians on the Hermitian support we obtain a discrete instance of the spectral representation of stationary kernels, inducing an exact stationary Gaussian-process prior over filters on the discrete circle/torus. We exploit this to define a practical spectral prior and a Hermitian-aware low-rank-plus-diagonal variational posterior in real coordinates. Empirically, spectral circulant/BCCB layers are effective compact building blocks in both (variational) Bayesian and point estimate regimes: compact Bayesian neural networks on MNIST->Fashion-MNIST, variational heads on frozen CIFAR-10 features, and deterministic ViT projections on CIFAR-10/Tiny ImageNet; spectral layers match strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and with tighter Lipschitz certificates."}

While state space models (SSMs) like Mamba promise linear complexity, their pixel-serial scanning remains a fundamental bottleneck for the millions of pixels in UHD content. We ask: must we process every pixel to understand the image? This paper introduces C$^2$SSM, a visual state space model that breaks this taboo by shifting from pixel-serial to cluster-serial scanning. Our core discovery is that the rich feature distribution of a UHD image can be distilled into a sparse set of semantic centroids via a neural-parameterized mixture model. C$^2$SSM leverages this to reformulate global modeling into a novel dual-path process: it scans and reasons over a handful of cluster centers, then diffuses the global context back to all pixels through a principled similarity distribution, all while a lightweight modulator preserves fine details. This cluster-centric paradigm achieves a decisive leap in efficiency, slashing computational costs while establishing new state-of-the-art results across five UHD restoration tasks. More than a solution, C$^2$SSM charts a new course for efficient large-scale vision: scan clusters, not pixels."}

This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost.

Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context\". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control."}

However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity.

Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects.

In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds."}

We address this limitation through the concept of edge prioritization, ranking candidate edges by their utility for SfM.

In contrast, heterogeneous quantization, which allocates different bitwidths to individual layers, can mitigate these drawbacks.

However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of \"trigger word-target image\" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%. MasqLoRA reveals a severe and unique threat in the AI supply chain, underscoring the urgent need for dedicated defense mechanisms for the LoRA-centric sharing ecosystem."}

Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies.

Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."}

To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals.

The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes.

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF."}

When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences.

Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."}

Synthetic data offers a practical substitute for downstream development, and large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful engines for generating it. However, existing private text generation methods are severely inefficient: they are data-intensive, computationally slow, and often require large private corpora or batch sizes to achieve usable quality. We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes. Furthermore, we enhance our method by utilizing pretrained (base) models and introducing fixed-shot prompting to boost generation diversity and fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that EPSVec outperforms existing baselines in distributional alignment and downstream utility, particularly in low-data regimes, while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding."}

This constraint poses a bottleneck for large-scale PDE pre-training based on neural operators. To address these challenges, we propose a large-scale PDE pre-trained neural operator based on a nested Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.

By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that progressive scheduling is a reliable compute-reduction strategy across model families, with curriculum-specific benefits contingent on the interaction between model capacity and task complexity."}

Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. % as part of the prompt. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety."}

Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving."}

This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.\n  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.\n  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events.

To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds.

We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance.

Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages.

We first establish highly proficient ASR and NMT components: a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m model achieved a state-of-the-art 2.72% CER on OpenSLR-54, and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT model reached a 28.32 BLEU score on the FLORES-200 benchmark. We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline. It establishes an optimized baseline and demonstrates a critical architectural insight for developing cascaded speech translation systems for similar low-resource languages."}

This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification."}

To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks. Our work demonstrates that explicit mode-level decoupling enables both robust multi-modal modeling and reactive closed-loop control for robotic manipulation."}

Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security.

Yet their real-world adoption is limited, partly due to non-intuitive trainer/therapist-trainee/patient interactions. To address this gap, we present a haptic teleoperation system for trainers to remotely guide and monitor the movements of a trainee wearing an arm exoskeleton. The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand. These findings support the feasibility of our proposed interface for effective remote human-robot physical interaction. Future work should assess its usability and efficacy for clinical populations in restoring clinicians' sense of agency during robot-assisted therapy."}

Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe.

Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients.

Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting.

Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing."}

Existing resources often suffer from semantic drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality translation of datasets and benchmarks. We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking method, T-RANK, allows for significantly higher quality outputs compared to traditional pipelines. Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment. We release both the framework and the improved benchmarks to facilitate robust and reproducible multilingual AI development."}

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%. Project page: https://yy-gx.github.io/LiLo-VLA/."}

Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations."}

Additionally, the method of acquiring high-quality data through professional motion capture systems is constrained by costs, making it difficult to achieve large-scale scalability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop automated motion data generation and iterative framework. It can generate high-quality motion data with rich action semantics, including martial arts, dance, combat, sports, gymnastics, and more. Furthermore, our framework enables difficulty iteration of policies and data through physical metrics and objective evaluations, allowing the trained tracker to break through its original difficulty limits. On the PHC single-primitive tracker, using only approximately 1/10 of the AMASS dataset size, the average failure rate on the test set (2201 clips) is reduced by 45\\% compared to the baseline. Finally, we conduct comprehensive ablation and comparative experiments to highlight the rationality and advantages of our framework."}

Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem."}

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation. Furthermore, we integrate dreamed and observed scene structures to enable long- horizon planning, producing farsighted trajectories that promote efficient and thorough exploration. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that Dream-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy, mapping quality, and exploration efficiency.

To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.
