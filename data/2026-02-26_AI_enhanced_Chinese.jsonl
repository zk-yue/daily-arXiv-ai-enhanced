When individuals face disaster situations, they often experience confusion and lack the domain-specific knowledge and experience necessary to determine appropriate responses and actions. While disaster information is continuously updated, even when utilizing RAG search and large language models for inquiries, obtaining relevant domain knowledge about natural disasters and experiences similar to one's specific situation is not guaranteed. When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences. Utilizing the cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads architecture with LoRA efficiency optimization, we achieved 70.4\\% End Position accuracy with only 5.7\\% of the total parameters (6.7M/117M). Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of Japanese BERT-base optimization and Bi-LSTM contextual understanding achieves accuracy levels suitable for real disaster response scenarios, attaining a 0.885 Span F1 score. Future challenges include: establishing natural disaster Q\\&A benchmark datasets, fine-tuning foundation models with disaster knowledge, developing lightweight and power-efficient edge AI Disaster Q\\&A applications for situations with insufficient power and communication during disasters, and addressing disaster knowledge base updates and continual learning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u65e5\u672c\u707e\u5bb3\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316BERT\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408Bi-LSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285.7%\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8670.4%\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u6df7\u4e71\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u76845.7%\uff086.7M/117M\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8670.4%\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.885\u7684Span F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e5\u672cBERT-base\u4f18\u5316\u4e0eBi-LSTM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u7528\u707e\u5bb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u707e\u5bb3\u95ee\u7b54\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u5bb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIA\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf920%-80%\u7684token\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u7ea7\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e72\u9884\u662f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u624d\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\uff08\u9ad8\u71b5\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf920%-80%\u7684token\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eQwen3\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e72\u988420%\u7684token\u5c31\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u5e72\u9884\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff08\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4e0eBest-of-N\u7b49\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In health economics, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) depend on the correct identification of publications that use the EQ-5D, but manual screening of large volumes of scientific literature is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines.

A fundamental challenge in these tasks is the uncertainties when operating in space, e.g., in measurements of satellites' states, which can make future states difficult to predict. Another challenge is that satellites' onboard processors are typically much slower than their terrestrial counterparts. Therefore, to address these challenges we propose to solve an ARPOD problem with feedback optimization, which computes inputs to a system by measuring its outputs, feeding them into an optimization algorithm in the loop, and computing some number of iterations towards an optimal input. We focus on satellite rendezvous, and satellites' dynamics are modeled using the continuous-time Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which are marginally stable. We develop an asymptotically stabilizing controller for them, and we use discrete-time gradient descent in the loop to compute inputs to them. Then, we analyze the hybrid feedback optimization system formed by the stabilized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with gradient descent in the loop. We show that this model is well-posed and that maximal solutions are both complete and non-Zeno. Then, we show that solutions converge exponentially fast to a ball around a rendezvous point, and we bound the radius of that ball in terms of system parameters. Simulations show that this approach provides up to a 98.4\\% reduction in the magnitude of disturbances across a range of simulations, which illustrates the viability of hybrid feedback optimization for autonomous satellite rendezvous.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u536b\u661f\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ea4\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u63a5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u661f\u8f7d\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Clohessy-Wiltshire\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u9002\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u89e3\u662f\u5b8c\u5907\u4e14\u975eZeno\u7684\u3002\u89e3\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4ea4\u4f1a\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7403\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7403\u57df\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe98.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u536b\u661f\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We propose Latent Context Compilation, a framework that fundamentally shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation. By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold.

In this work, we present persistent monitoring tasks for HUAUVs by combining Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Transfer Learning to enable cross-domain adaptability. Our approach employs a shared DRL architecture trained on Lidar sensor data (on air) and Sonar data (underwater), demonstrating the feasibility of a unified policy for both environments. We further show that the methodology presents promising results, taking into account the uncertainty of the environment and the dynamics of multiple mobile targets.

We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext.

Synthetic data offers a practical substitute for downstream development, and large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful engines for generating it. However, existing private text generation methods are severely inefficient: they are data-intensive, computationally slow, and often require large private corpora or batch sizes to achieve usable quality. We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding.

In our set-up, the sensor measurements are considered to be private and are jointly correlated with an underlying process. A fusion center combines the private sensor measurements and releases its output to an honest-but-curious party, which is responsible for estimating the state of the underlying process based on the fusion center's output. The privacy leakage incurred by the fusion policy is quantified using R\u00e9nyi differential privacy. We formulate the privacy-aware fusion design as a constrained finite-horizon optimization problem, in which the fusion policy and the state estimation are jointly optimized to minimize the state estimation error subject to a total privacy budget constraint. We derive the constrained optimality conditions for the proposed optimization problem and use them to characterize the structural properties of the optimal fusion policy. Unlike classical differential privacy mechanisms, the optimal fusion policy is shown to adaptively allocates the privacy budget and regulates the adversary's belief in a closed-loop manner. To reduce the computational burden of solving the resulting constrained optimality equations, we parameterize the fusion policy using a structured Gaussian distribution and show that the parameterized fusion policy satisfies the privacy constraint. We further develop a numerical algorithm to jointly optimize the fusion policy and state estimator.

While fusing inertial reading with satellite positioning in an extended Kalman filter provides short-term navigation continuity, low-cost inertial sensors suffer from rapid error accumulation during prolonged outages. Existing information aiding approaches, such as the non-holonomic constraint, impose rigid equality assumptions on vehicle motion that may be violated under dynamic urban driving conditions, limiting their robustness precisely when aiding is most needed. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch information aiding framework that fuses equality and inequality motion constraints through a variance-weighted scheme, requiring only a software modification to an existing navigation filter with no additional sensors or hardware. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available urban datasets featuring various inertial sensors, road conditions, and dynamics, covering a total duration of 4.3 hours of recorded data. Under Full GNSS availability, the method reduces vertical position error by 16.7% and improves altitude accuracy by 50.1% over the standard non-holonomic constraint. Under GNSS-denied conditions, vertical drift is reduced by 24.2% and altitude accuracy improves by 20.2%. These results demonstrate that replacing hard motion equality assumptions with physically motivated inequality bounds is a practical and cost-free strategy for improving navigation resilience, continuity, and drift robustness without relying on additional sensors, map data, or learned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u6539\u5584\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u5bfc\u822a\u9762\u4e34\u536b\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u521a\u6027\u7b49\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5bfc\u822a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u603b\u65f6\u957f4.3\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u5728GNSS\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e16.7%\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad850.1%\uff1b\u5728GNSS\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c1124.2%\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad820.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6709\u754c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u96f6\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u5730\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We introduce HorizonForge, a unified framework that reconstructs scenes as editable Gaussian Splats and Meshes, enabling fine-grained 3D manipulation and language-driven vehicle insertion. Edits are rendered through a noise-aware video diffusion process that enforces spatial and temporal consistency, producing diverse scene variations in a single feed-forward pass without per-trajectory optimization. To standardize evaluation, we further propose HorizonSuite, a comprehensive benchmark spanning ego- and agent-level editing tasks such as trajectory modifications and object manipulation. Extensive experiments show that Gaussian-Mesh representation delivers substantially higher fidelity than alternative 3D representations, and that temporal priors from video diffusion are essential for coherent synthesis. Combining these findings, HorizonForge establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for photorealistic, controllable driving simulation, achieving an 83.4% user-preference gain and a 25.19% FID improvement over the second best state-of-the-art method.

To address this challenge, we introduce GraSPer (Graph-based Sparse Personalized Reasoning), a novel framework for enhancing personalized text generation under sparse context. GraSPer first augments user context by predicting items that the user would likely interact with in the future. With reasoning alignment, it then generates texts for these interactions to enrich the augmented context. In the end, it generates personalized outputs conditioned on both the real and synthetic histories, ensuring alignment with user style and preferences.

We introduce a Task-Level Iterative Learning Control method for dynamic manipulation of deformable objects. We demonstrate this method on a non-planar rope manipulation task called the flying knot. Using a single human demonstration and a simplified rope model, the method learns directly on hardware without reliance on large amounts of demonstration data or massive amounts of simulation. At each iteration, the algorithm constructs a local inverse model of the robot and rope by solving a quadratic program to propagate task-space errors into action updates. We evaluate performance across 7 different kinds of ropes, including chain, latex surgical tubing, and braided and twisted ropes, ranging in thicknesses of 7--25mm and densities of 0.013--0.5 kg/m. Learning achieves a 100\\% success rate within 10 trials on all ropes. Furthermore, the method can successfully transfer between most rope types in approximately 2--5 trials. https://flying-knots.github.io", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5728\u98de\u7ed3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u6210\u529f\u7387", "motivation": "\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u7ef3\u7d22\uff09\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e14\u5448\u73b0\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u63a7\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90fd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u7ef3\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6216\u4eff\u771f\uff1b3\uff09\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u7ef3\u7d22\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9006\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7ef3\u7d22\uff08\u94fe\u6761\u3001\u4e73\u80f6\u624b\u672f\u7ba1\u3001\u7f16\u7ec7\u7ef3\u548c\u7ede\u5408\u7ef3\uff0c\u539a\u5ea67-25mm\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ea60.013-0.5 kg/m\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u572810\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5185\u8fbe\u5230100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u7ea62-5\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ef3\u7d22\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.\n  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u98df\u8005-\u730e\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79cd\u7fa4\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u6b63\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6b63\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79cd\u7fa4\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u5fc5\u987b\u4e3a\u6b63\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u4e5f\u5fc5\u987b\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u706d\u7edd\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u79cd\u7fa4\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6355\u98df\u8005-\u730e\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u7684\"\u751c\u70b9\"\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e2d\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6355\u98df\u8005-\u730e\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u4f18\u96c5\u3001\u5177\u6709\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Volterra\u578b\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u975e\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684Volterra\u578b\u6784\u9020\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53cd\u9988\u548cCLF\u5e76\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u524d\u9988\u548c\u53cd\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700LaSalle\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6355\u98df\u8005-\u730e\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3a\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u6d01\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u6355\u98df\u8005-\u730e\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6b63\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6b63\u63a7\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002"}}

By consolidating cutting-edge algorithms, including quantization, speculative decoding, token pruning, and distillation. AngelSlim provides a unified pipeline that streamlines the transition from model compression to industrial-scale deployment. To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning. By integrating these compression strategies from low-level implementations, AngelSlim enables algorithm-focused research and tool-assisted deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "AngelSlim\u662f\u817e\u8baf\u6df7\u5143\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u3001token\u526a\u679d\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301FP8/INT8\u91cf\u5316\u30012-bit\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "1. \u96c6\u6210\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecFP8/INT8\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u59822-bit\u6a21\u578bHY-1.8B-int2\uff09\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u52a8\u6001token\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u7a00\u758f\u6838\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff1b4. \u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff1aIDPruner\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0cSamp\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u526a\u679d\u97f3\u9891token\u3002", "result": "1. \u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u53ef\u884c\u76842-bit\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff1a\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b01.8-2.0\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3. \u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1a\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e\u9996token\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b4. \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u538b\u7f29\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u97f3\u9891token\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "AngelSlim\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5230\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, modeling and planning contact-rich interactions for soft robots remain challenging: dense contact candidates along the body create redundant constraints and rank-deficient LCPs, while the disparity between high stiffness and low friction introduces severe ill-conditioning. Existing approaches rely on problem-specific approximations or penalty-based treatments. This letter presents a unified complementarity-based framework for soft-robot contact modeling and planning that brings contact modeling, manipulation, and planning into a unified, physically consistent formulation. We develop a robust Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) model tailored to discretized soft robots and address these challenges with a three-stage conditioning pipeline: inertial rank selection to remove redundant contacts, Ruiz equilibration to correct scale disparity and ill-conditioning, and lightweight Tikhonov regularization on normal blocks. Building on the same formulation, we introduce a kinematically guided warm-start strategy that enables dynamic trajectory optimization through contact using Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) and demonstrate its effectiveness on contact-rich ball manipulation tasks. In conclusion, CUSP provides a new foundation for unifying contact modeling, simulation, and planning in soft robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCUSP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u75c5\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a5\u89e6\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u79e9\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9ad8\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u6469\u64e6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u5165\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u60ef\u6027\u79e9\u9009\u62e9\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u63a5\u89e6\uff0cRuiz\u5747\u8861\u6821\u6b63\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u75c5\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5411\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u4e92\u8865\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7403\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002CUSP\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "CUSP\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u548c\u9884\u70ed\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.\n  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.\n  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events.

Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARLArena\u6846\u67b6\u548cSAMPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6781\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u73af\u5883\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51faARLArena\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51faSAMPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7f13\u89e3ARL\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "SAMPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aARL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We present a novel framework for dynamic LoRA adapter composition that leverages similarity retrieval in vector databases to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse NLP tasks. Our approach constructs a task-aware vector database by embedding training examples from 22 datasets spanning commonsense reasoning, question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. At inference time, we retrieve the most similar training examples, compute task similarity distributions via nucleus sampling, and dynamically merge relevant LoRA adapters using retrieval weighted fusion strategies. We evaluated four merging methods Linear, Concatenation, TIES, and Magnitude Prune demonstrating that our dataset centric retrieval approach often matches or exceeds the performance of individually fine-tuned task-specific adapters. Notably, Linear merging achieves 70.95% on PIQA and 77.62% on RTE, substantially outperforming single-task baselines (46% and 52%, respectively). Our framework requires no additional retriever training, operates with frozen embeddings, and enables efficient, interpretable adapter composition.

However, under the dielectric scatterer model, the PA radiation pattern depends on its geometry. This letter investigates the radiation patterns of PAs with different geometries through full-wave simulations and measurements, and demonstrates how geometry influences the radiation directivity. In addition, an arc-shaped PA is introduced to enable transmit-direction control in PA systems. A PA system prototype consisting of a dielectric waveguide, waveguide transitions, and a PA element is proposed. Prototype measurements are used to validate the simulations and to characterize the directivity of square and triangular PAs, and the measurement procedure can be applied to obtain radiation patterns for PAs with general geometries.

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u5347\u5230L2\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u6b63\u4ea4\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6982\u7387\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6570\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u9971\u548c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u51e0\u4f55\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u6982\u7387\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4L2(\u03c0_k)\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u6b63\u4ea4\u6761\u4ef6<v,1>=0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u6295\u5f71\u5b9a\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6v\u2265-1\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u754c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\u5c06\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6709\u9650\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGOPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u71b5\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u671f\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "GOPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e38\u6570Hessian\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u975e\u9971\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5728\u7684\u6b7b\u533a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.\n  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference.

Phrases like \"This is urgent\" or \"As your supervisor\" can shift model behavior without altering task content. We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\"\u8bed\u7528\u6846\u67b6\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\uff08\u5982\"\u8fd9\u5f88\u7d27\u6025\"\u6216\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f60\u7684\u4e3b\u7ba1\"\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\"\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u95ee\"\u5bf9LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u672c\u8eab\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u9694\u79bb\u6846\u67b6\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u6307\u4ee4-\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u8303\u5206\u79bb\uff1b2) \u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06400\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a4\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u7c07\u4e2d\u768413\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u53d8\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u4ee4\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u504f\u5411\u6846\u67b6\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u8bed\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u8bed\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \\textbf{MMLoP} (\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Lo}w-Rank \\textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \\textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\\% on base-to-novel generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMLoP\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u970011.5K\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f4e\u79e9\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMLoP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6bcf\u5c42Transformer\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u8865\u5145\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u81ea\u8c03\u8282\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5747\u5300\u6f02\u79fb\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c11\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMMLoP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u5230\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523079.70%\u7684\u8c03\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "MMLoP\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions.

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee4\u724c\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u56de\u6536\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8349\u7a3f\u4ee4\u724c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5931\u8d25\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u56de\u6536\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8349\u7a3f\u4ee4\u724c\u6811\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5931\u8d25\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b3) \u6d88\u9664\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u5f00\u9500\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad83.3\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Vehicles must maneuver safely near animals and fragile structures while coping with currents, variable illumination and limited sensing. Previous approaches simplify these problems by leveraging soft materials and bioinspired swimming designs, but such platforms remain limited in terms of deployable autonomy. Here we present a sea turtle-inspired autonomous underwater robot that closed the gap between bioinspired locomotion and field-ready autonomy through a tightly integrated, vision-driven control stack. The robot combines robust depth-heading stabilization with obstacle avoidance and target-centric control, enabling it to track and interact with moving objects in complex terrain. We validate the robot in controlled pool experiments and in a live coral reef exhibit at the New England Aquarium, demonstrating stable operation and reliable tracking of fast-moving marine animals and human divers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated biomimetic robotic system, combining novel hardware, control, and field experiments, deployed to track and monitor real marine animals in their natural environment. During off-tether experiments, we demonstrate safe navigation around obstacles (91\\% success rate in the aquarium exhibit) and introduce a low-compute onboard tracking mode.

Experimental results demonstrate that FlowFixer outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, setting a new benchmark for high-fidelity subject-driven generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowFixer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6062\u590d\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7ec6\u8282", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff08SDG\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u8282", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53bb\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aCLIP\u6216DINO\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf", "result": "FlowFixer\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684SDG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6", "conclusion": "FlowFixer\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6(fEDM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u591a\u5143\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7248fEDM+\u3002", "motivation": "\u539ffEDM\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u6a21\u5757(ETM)\uff0c\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u9053\u5fb7\u539f\u5219\u660e\u786e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u6743\u539f\u5219\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\uff1b2. \u7528\u591a\u5143\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u66ff\u4ee3\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u7167\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u53c2\u7167\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53c2\u7167\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u539f\u5219\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684fEDM+\u6846\u67b6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f26\u7406\u654f\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "fEDM+\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u591a\u5143\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u591a\u5143\u4ef7\u503c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($\u0394$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering.

Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22).

These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAR\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6c7d\u8f66\u6e05\u6d17\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f385%\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u548cRAG\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540e\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\"\u6c7d\u8f66\u6e05\u6d17\u95ee\u9898\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u8981\u9690\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u54ea\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u6e29\u5ea60.7\uff0ctop_p 1.0\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u91cf\u9694\u79bb\u7814\u7a76\uff086\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd20\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5171120\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\uff08STAR\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001RAG\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "STAR\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5355\u72ec\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f385%\uff08p=0.001\uff0cFisher\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u503c\u6bd413.22\uff09\uff1b\u6dfb\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u534710\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u518d\u63d0\u53475\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u5806\u6808\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f3a\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u8fbe\uff09\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0cSTAR\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We introduce IslamicLegalBench, the first benchmark evaluating LLMs across seven schools of Islamic jurisprudence, with 718 instances covering 13 tasks of varying complexity. Evaluation of nine state-of-the-art models reveals major limitations: the best model achieves only 68% correctness with 21% hallucination, while several models fall below 35% correctness and exceed 55% hallucination. Few-shot prompting provides minimal gains, improving only 2 of 9 models by >1%. Moderate-complexity tasks requiring exact knowledge show the highest errors, whereas high-complexity tasks display apparent competence through semantic reasoning. False premise detection indicates risky sycophancy, with 6 of 9 models accepting misleading assumptions at rates above 40%.

A unified geometric model is developed, yielding a coupled agent--payload differential--algebraic system that explicitly captures contact wrenches, payload dynamics, and internal force redundancy. A leader--follower architecture is adopted in which a designated leader generates a desired payload wrench based on geometric tracking errors, while the remaining agents realize this wrench through constraint-consistent force allocation.\n  Unknown disturbances and modeling uncertainties are compensated using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. High-probability bounds on the learning error are explicitly incorporated into the control design, combining GP feedforward compensation with geometric feedback. Lyapunov analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of the payload tracking errors with high probability, with an ultimate bound that scales with the GP predictive uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u521a\u6027\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8865\u507f\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5728\u521a\u6027\u6293\u53d6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u521a\u6027\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5185\u529b\u5197\u4f59\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8865\u507f\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8026\u5408\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5fae\u5206-\u4ee3\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u751f\u6210\u671f\u671b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u529b\u77e9\uff0c\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8865\u507f\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u8fb9\u754c\u7eb3\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6700\u7ec8\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Existing multimodal models achieve strong results when generating SVGs from clean renderings or textual descriptions, but they fall short in real-world scenarios where natural images introduce noise, clutter, and domain shifts. A central challenge in this direction is the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce the WildSVG Benchmark, formed by two complementary datasets: Natural WildSVG, built from real images containing company logos paired with their SVG annotations, and Synthetic WildSVG, which blends complex SVG renderings into real scenes to simulate difficult conditions.

While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints.

Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown strong potential for capturing multimodal futures, yet existing approaches such as cVMD suffer from slow sampling, limited exploitation of generative diversity and brittle scenario encodings.\n  This work introduces cVMDx, an enhanced diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that improves efficiency, robustness and multimodal predictive capability. Through DDIM sampling, cVMDx achieves up to a 100x reduction in inference time, enabling practical multi-sample generation for uncertainty estimation. A fitted Gaussian Mixture Model further provides tractable multimodal predictions from the generated trajectories. In addition, a CVQ-VAE variant is evaluated for scenario encoding. Experiments on the publicly available highD dataset show that cVMDx achieves higher accuracy and significantly improved efficiency over cVMD, enabling fully stochastic, multimodal trajectory prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "cVMDx\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DDIM\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0100\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728highD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4cVMD\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u590d\u6742\u3001\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6837\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fa\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982cVMD\u5b58\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u7801\u8106\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51facVMDx\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528DDIM\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u62df\u5408\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86CVQ-VAE\u53d8\u4f53\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7684highD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0ccVMDx\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4cVMD\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "cVMDx\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our approach generalizes our previous work (Rezende et al., 2022) and reduces to it when considering the Lie group of translations in Euclidean space. Since the proofs in Rezende et al. (2022) rely on key properties such as the orthogonality between the convergent and traversal components, we extend these results by leveraging Lie group properties. These properties also allow the control input to be non-redundant, meaning it matches the dimension of the Lie group, rather than the potentially larger dimension of the space in which the group is embedded. This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field. We experimentally validate the proposed method using a robotic manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u8fde\u901a\u77e9\u9635\u674e\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5168\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e76\u6cbf\u7740\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u66f2\u7ebf\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u674e\u7fa4\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5148\u524d\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u79fb\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u77e9\u9635\u674e\u7fa4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982SE(3)\u4e0a\u7684\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5197\u4f59\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u674e\u7fa4\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u6269\u5c55\u5148\u524d\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u904d\u5386\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9SE(3)\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u8fde\u901a\u77e9\u9635\u674e\u7fa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5197\u4f59\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u674e\u7fa4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u800c\u975e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8eSE(3)\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u521a\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u674e\u7fa4\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5411\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7b49\u81ea\u7531\u79fb\u52a8\u65cb\u8f6c\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u674e\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We introduce ECHOSAT, a global and temporally consistent tree height map at 10 m resolution spanning multiple years. To this end, we resort to multi-sensor satellite data to train a specialized vision transformer model, which performs pixel-level temporal regression. A self-supervised growth loss regularizes the predictions to follow growth curves that are in line with natural tree development, including gradual height increases over time, but also abrupt declines due to forest loss events such as fires. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model improves state-of-the-art accuracies in the context of single-year predictions. We also provide the first global-scale height map that accurately quantifies tree growth and disturbances over time.

The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%).

We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models. These results demonstrate that enhancing implicit reasoning capabilities can significantly improve complex instruction following.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%.

Current evaluation faces two primary challenges: 1) a reliance on singular metrics like Pass@1, creating a \"high-score illusion\" that ignores the quality, efficiency, and soundness of the reasoning process; and 2) the failure of static benchmarks to quantify crucial attributes like robustness and latent capability. To address these gaps, we introduce TRACE (Trajectory-Aware Comprehensive Evaluation), a framework that holistically assesses the entire problem-solving trajectory. To counter the \"high-score illusion\", we propose a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function that quantifies process efficiency and cognitive quality, including evidence grounding, alongside accuracy. To measure deeper attributes, TRACE introduces a Scaffolded Capability Assessment protocol, quantifying an agent's latent ability by determining the minimum guidance needed for success. Our contributions include the TRACE framework, its novel metrics, and the accompanying DeepResearch-Bench with controllable complexity.

With the ongoing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and increasing vehicle connectivity, the integration of traffic information has become crucial for improving both energy efficiency and thermal comfort in modern vehicles. To enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes a novel traffic-aware hierarchical integrated thermal and energy management (TA-ITEM) strategy for connected HEVs. In the upper layer, global reference trajectories for battery state of charge (SOC) and cabin temperature are planned using traffic flow speed information obtained from ITSs. In the lower layer, a real-time model predictive control (MPC)-based ITEM controller is developed, which incorporates a novel Transformer-based speed predictor with driving condition recognition (TF-DCR) to enable anticipatory tracking of the reference trajectories. Numerical simulations are conducted under various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed TA-ITEM approach outperforms conventional rule-based and MPC-SP approaches, with average fuel consumption reductions of 56.36\\% and 5.84\\%, respectively, while maintaining superior thermal regulation and cabin comfort. These findings confirm the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of TA-ITEM and underscore the advantages of incorporating traffic information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u70ed\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u71c3\u6cb9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u548c\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u4e92\u8054\u6027\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u70ed\u8212\u9002\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u901a\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u70ed\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u5229\u7528ITS\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u901f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u89c4\u5212\u7535\u6c60SOC\u548c\u8f66\u53a2\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u4e0b\u5c42\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6ITEM\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5177\u6709\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u529f\u80fd\u7684Transformer\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0cTA-ITEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548cMPC-SP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u71c3\u6cb9\u6d88\u8017\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e56.36%\u548c5.84%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u70ed\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u8f66\u53a2\u8212\u9002\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TA-ITEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing.

While model-based controllers can achieve high motion accuracy under nominal conditions, their robustness and responsiveness often degrade in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties. This work investigates reinforcement learning for omnidirectional aerial motion control on over-actuated tiltable quadrotors that prioritizes robustness and agility. We present a learning-based control framework that enables efficient acquisition of coordinated rotor-joint behaviors for reaching target poses in the $SE(3)$ space. To achieve reliable sim-to-real transfer while preserving motion accuracy, we integrate system identification with minimal and physically consistent domain randomization. Compared with a state-of-the-art NMPC controller, the proposed method achieves comparable six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking accuracy, while demonstrating superior robustness and generalization across diverse tasks, enabling zero-shot deployment on real hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u503e\u659c\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5168\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfNMPC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u503e\u659c\u65cb\u7ffc\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5411\u673a\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5173\u8282\u548c\u65cb\u7ffc\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u6807\u79f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u65cb\u7ffc-\u5173\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0SE(3)\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NMPC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u8fc7\u9a71\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u5168\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faPSF-Med\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b06\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66VLM\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u57288%-58%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u79fb\u9664\u56fe\u50cf\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165PSF-Med\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b19,748\u4e2a\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7ea692,000\u4e2a\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u8f6c\u8ff0\uff1b2) \u6d4b\u91cf6\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66VLM\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u7684yes/no\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b4) \u5bf9MedGemma 4B\u5e94\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b5) \u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u4fee\u8865\uff1b6) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u94b3\u5236\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u3002", "result": "1) 6\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66VLM\u7684\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u57288%\u523058%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff1b2) \u4f4e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff1b3) \u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7b2c17\u5c42\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4) \u79fb\u9664\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u53ef\u6062\u590d45%\u7684yes-minus-no\u5bf9\u6570\u8fb9\u9645\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u9006\u8f6c15%\u7684\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff1b5) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u94b3\u5236\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u5c06\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e31%\uff0c\u4ec5\u635f\u59311.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5e72\u9884\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task.

Existing benchmarks often overlook these critical factors, limiting their ability to evaluate both feasibility and safety. We introduce SPOC, a benchmark for safety-aware embodied task planning, which integrates strict partial observability, physical constraints, step-by-step planning, and goal-condition-based evaluation. Covering diverse household hazards such as fire, fluid, injury, object damage, and pollution, SPOC enables rigorous assessment through both state and constraint-based online metrics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models struggle to ensure safety-aware planning, particularly under implicit constraints.

However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation.

Bernstein et al. (2014) introduced this problem in 2014 and presented an algorithm that guarantees sublinear approachability rates for opportunistic approachability. However, this algorithm requires the ability to produce calibrated online predictions of the adversary's actions, a problem whose standard implementations require time exponential in the ambient dimension and result in approachability rates that scale as $T^{-O(1/d)}$. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for opportunistic approachability that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$ (and an inefficient one that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/3})$), bypassing the need for an online calibration subroutine. Moreover, in the case where the dimension of the adversary's action set is at most two, we show it is possible to obtain the optimal rate of $O(T^{-1/2})$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u6027\u8d8b\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86O(T^{-1/4})\u7684\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u22642\u65f6\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18O(T^{-1/2})\u3002", "motivation": "Bernstein\u7b49\u4eba2014\u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u6027\u8d8b\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u624b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u4e14\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3aT^{-O(1/d)}\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0O(T^{-1/4})\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\uff1b2) \u4f4e\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0O(T^{-1/3})\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u5bf9\u624b\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u22642\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18O(T^{-1/2})\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u6027\u8d8b\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230O(T^{-1/4})\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f4e\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230O(T^{-1/3})\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18O(T^{-1/2})\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u6027\u8d8b\u8fd1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387\u3002"}}

However, the fixed difficulty distribution of datasets limits the performance ceiling of the trained control policies. Additionally, the method of acquiring high-quality data through professional motion capture systems is constrained by costs, making it difficult to achieve large-scale scalability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop automated motion data generation and iterative framework. It can generate high-quality motion data with rich action semantics, including martial arts, dance, combat, sports, gymnastics, and more. Furthermore, our framework enables difficulty iteration of policies and data through physical metrics and objective evaluations, allowing the trained tracker to break through its original difficulty limits. On the PHC single-primitive tracker, using only approximately 1/10 of the AMASS dataset size, the average failure rate on the test set (2201 clips) is reduced by 45\\% compared to the baseline.

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7ed3\u8282\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SSAA\u548cFDUA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u9891\u57df\u653b\u51fb\u96be\u4ee5\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f71\u50cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7ed3\u8282B\u8d85\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff1a1) SSAA\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6591\u70b9\u653e\u5927\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u5411\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2) FDUA\uff08\u9891\u57df\u8d85\u58f0\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\uff1a\u968f\u673a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u968f\u673a\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u805a\u5408\u3002\u4f7f\u7528U-Net\u6a21\u578b\u5728192\u4e2a\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747Dice\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a0.76\u3002SSAA\u653b\u51fb\u4f7fDSC\u964d\u4f4e0.29\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08SSIM=0.94\uff09\uff1bFDUA\u653b\u51fb\u4f7fDSC\u964d\u4f4e0.11\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff08SSIM=0.82\uff09\u3002\u9488\u5bf9SSAA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u5747\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584DSC\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53bb\u566a\u6062\u590d\u6700\u5927\uff08+0.10\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u968f\u673a\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08+0.09\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff08+0.08\uff09\u3002\u9488\u5bf9FDUA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u9891\u57df\u6270\u52a8\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates.

Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework, demonstrating a forward jump over a 0.12 m obstacle and a vertical jump reaching 0.5 m.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56db\u8db3\u8f6e\u817f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408NMPC\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u548cDE\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5782\u76f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u524d\u8df3\u548c\u540e\u7a7a\u7ffb\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u654f\u6377\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u56db\u8db3\u8f6e\u817f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u817f\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6e\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8f6e\u817f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u8f6e\u817f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08NMPC\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\uff08DE\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8df3\u8dc3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5229\u7528\u8f6e\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u817f\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8df3\u8dc3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d8a\u8fc70.12\u7c73\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u524d\u8df3\u548c\u8fbe\u52300.5\u7c73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5782\u76f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u524d\u8df3\u548c\u540e\u7a7a\u7ffb\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u654f\u6377\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56db\u8db3\u8f6e\u817f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8f6e\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8df3\u8dc3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6e\u817f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u654f\u6377\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001VPR\u5efa\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u90fd\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u5c40\u90e8VPR\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u8981\u6c42\uff1a(1)\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8Recall@1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c(2)\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff08Recall Achievement Rate, RAR\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Nordland\u548cOxford RobotCar\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u81f3\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001VPR\u5efa\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40Recall@1\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684RAR\u6307\u6807\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aVPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5230\u957f\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies.

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6536\u7f29\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bbd\u677e\u72b6\u6001\u9010\u6b65\u6536\u7d27\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBFs\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u5408\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u65f6\u6700\u5bbd\u677e\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u901a\u8fc7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Dynamic Modality Diffusion Policy (ADM-DP), a framework that integrates vision, tactile, and graph-based (multi-agent pose) modalities for coordinated control. ADM-DP introduces four key innovations. First, an enhanced visual encoder merges RGB and point-cloud features via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation to enrich perception. Second, a tactile-guided grasping strategy uses Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR) feedback to detect insufficient contact and trigger corrective grasp refinement, improving grasp stability. Third, a graph-based collision encoder leverages shared tool center point (TCP) positions of multiple agents as structured kinematic context to maintain spatial awareness and reduce inter-agent interference. Fourth, an Adaptive Modality Attention Mechanism (AMAM) dynamically re-weights modalities according to task context, enabling flexible fusion. For scalability and modularity, a decoupled training paradigm is employed in which agents learn independent policies while sharing spatial information. This maintains low interdependence between agents while retaining collective awareness. Across seven multi-agent tasks, ADM-DP achieves 12-25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies show the greatest improvements in tasks requiring multiple sensory modalities, validating our adaptive fusion strategy and demonstrating its robustness for diverse manipulation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADM-DP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57287\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534712-25%", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u9762\u4e34\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u6293\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADM-DP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) FiLM\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408RGB\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) FSR\u89e6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eTCP\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u78b0\u649e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b4) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b5) \u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f9712-25%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "ADM-DP\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged. However, they face intertwined challenges: low-quality pseudo-labels, unstable feature mining, and a lack of a unified training framework. This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings.

This study evaluates a two-step pipeline combining Aya-expanse-8B as a Persian-to-English translation model with five open-source small language models (SLMs) -- Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-1B-it -- for binary extraction of 13 clinical features from 1,221 anonymized Persian transcripts collected at a cancer palliative care call center. Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging. These findings establish a practical, privacy-preserving blueprint for deploying open-source SLMs in multilingual clinical NLP settings with limited infrastructure and annotation resources, and highlight the importance of jointly optimizing model scale and input language strategy for sensitive healthcare applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u533b\u7597\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90NLP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Aya-expanse-8B\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e94\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d613\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\uff0cQwen2.5-7B-Instruct\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528Aya-expanse-8B\u5c06\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u82f1\u8bed\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B-it\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d613\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u3001\u9a6c\u4fee\u65af\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5b8fF1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797\uff09\uff0cGemma-3-1B-it\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f31\u3002\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff087B-8B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548cMCC\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5c06\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7f3a\u5931\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u4ef7\u662f\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u751f\u7406\u75c7\u72b6\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u800c\u5fc3\u7406\u62b1\u6028\u3001\u884c\u653f\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8eaf\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u654f\u611f\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To mitigate this problem, we propose to computes word vectors directly from character strings, integrating both semantic and syntactic information. We denote this transformer-based approach Rich Character Embeddings (RCE). Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines transformer and convolutional mechanisms. Both vector representations can be used as a drop-in replacement for dictionary- and subtoken-based word embeddings in existing model architectures. It has the potential to improve performance for both large context-based language models like BERT and small models like word2vec for under-resourced and morphologically rich languages.

Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

We propose an effective and fully feedforward 3D editing framework based on the TRELLIS generative backbone, capable of modifying 3D models from a single editing view. Our framework addresses two key issues: adapting training-free 2D editing to structured 3D representations, and overcoming the bottleneck of appearance fidelity in compressed 3D features. To ensure geometric consistency, we introduce Voxel FlowEdit, an edit-driven flow in the sparse voxel latent space that achieves globally consistent 3D deformation in a single pass. To restore high-fidelity details, we develop a normal-guided single to multi-view generation module as an external appearance prior, successfully recovering high-frequency textures.

DAGS-SLAM fuses lightweight YOLO instance priors with geometric cues to estimate and temporally update MP, propagates MP to the front-end for dynamic-aware correspondence selection, and suppresses dynamic artifacts in the back-end via MP-guided optimization.

Project page: https://xk-huang.github.io/VecGlypher/", "summary": "Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "VecGlypher\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u793a\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u77e2\u91cf\u5b57\u5f62\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5149\u6805\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684SVG\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u8868\u548c\u5149\u6805\u5230\u77e2\u91cf\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u77e2\u91cf\u5b57\u5f62\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u566a\u58f0Envato\u5b57\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u638c\u63e1SVG\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b2) \u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684Google Fonts\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5305\u62ec\u5750\u6807\u6846\u67b6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u3001\u53bb\u91cd\u548c\u5750\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cfOOD\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cVecGlypher\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLM\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u77e2\u91cf\u5b57\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53c2\u8003\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8eDeepVecFont-v2\u548cDualVector\u3002", "conclusion": "VecGlypher\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u5b57\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b57\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions.

Although imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for generating natural robotic movements, simply replicating joint angle trajectories fails to capture the underlying principles of human motion. This study proposes a Gait Divergence Analysis Framework (GDAF), a unified biomechanical evaluation framework that systematically quantifies kinematic and kinetic discrepancies between humans and bipedal robots. We apply GDAF to systematically compare human and humanoid locomotion across 28 walking speeds. To enable reproducible analysis, we collect and release a speed-continuous humanoid locomotion dataset from a state-of-the-art humanoid controller. We further provide an open-source implementation of GDAF, including analysis, visualization, and MuJoCo-based tools, enabling quantitative, interpretable, and reproducible biomechanical analysis of humanoid locomotion. Results demonstrate that despite visually human-like motion generated by modern humanoid controllers, significant biomechanical divergence persists across speeds. Robots exhibit systematic deviations in gait symmetry, energy distribution, and joint coordination, indicating that substantial room remains for improving the biomechanical fidelity and energetic efficiency of humanoid locomotion. This work provides a quantitative benchmark for evaluating humanoid locomotion and offers data and versatile tools to support the development of more human-like and energetically efficient locomotion controllers.

In this work, we investigate how accurately large language models (LLMs) represent African American Vernacular English (AAVE). We analyze three LLMs to compare their usage of AAVE to the usage of humans who natively speak AAVE. We first analyzed interviews from the Corpus of Regional African American Language and TwitterAAE to identify the typical contexts where people use AAVE grammatical features such as ain't. We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE.

Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.95 on compound tasks, 0.84 on complex tasks, and 0.60 on vague tasks, improving over the previous state-of-the-art LaMMA-P by 2, 7, and 15 percentage points respectively.

With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm.

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings.

However, existing End-to-End (E2E) planning methods often simplify the parking task into a geometric path regression problem, neglecting explicit modeling of the vehicle's kinematic state. This \"dimensionality deficiency\" easily leads to physically infeasible trajectories and deviates from real human driving behavior, particularly at critical gear-shift points in multi-shot parking scenarios. In this paper, we propose SunnyParking, a novel dual-branch E2E architecture that achieves motion state awareness by jointly predicting spatial trajectories and discrete motion state sequences (e.g., forward/reverse). Additionally, we introduce a Fourier feature-based representation of target parking slots to overcome the resolution limitations of traditional bird's-eye view (BEV) approaches, enabling high-precision target interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates more robust and human-like trajectories in complex multi-shot parking scenarios, while significantly improving gear-shift point localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy.

Existing sentiment and sarcasm models largely focus on monolingual English or high-resource languages and struggle with transliteration variation, cultural references, and intra-sentential language switching. To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity. We construct the corpus through targeted social media collection, systematic filtering, and multi-annotator validation. We benchmark transformer-based models and evaluate zero-shot large language models under structured prompting. Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity. Zero-shot models achieve competitive micro-F1 scores but low exact match accuracy. Further analysis reveals that over 42\\% of negative sentiment instances in an external dataset exhibit sarcastic characteristics.

To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks.

A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u5e76\u975e\u8d8a\u591a\u8d8a\u597d\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8db3\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u624d\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5e38\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u4f55\u65f6\u771f\u6b63\u6539\u5584\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\uff1a1\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6570\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u6ce8\u5165\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5355\u4e00\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8db3\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002"}}

Endpoint regulation is incorporated into trajectory sampling to stabilize terminal behavior, while a momentum-aware dynamics enforces consistent velocity and acceleration evolution across consecutive trajectory segments.

Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently.

In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning.

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength.

While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u5206\u914d\u5668\u548c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u89d2\u8272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5355\u89d2\u8272\u573a\u666f\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027"}}

Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u5e94\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u62b5\u6297\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u5e94\u5bf9\u62b5\u6297\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u62b5\u6297\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u590d\u6742\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ca\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u73b0\u6709NLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u4f53\u54a8\u8be2\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u6cbb\u7597\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9488\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u62b5\u6297\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u56de\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u6c9f\u901a\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u54a8\u8be2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u65ad\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u6c9f\u901a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0877-81% F1\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\u548cClaude-3.5-Sonnet\uff0845-59% F1\uff09\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u53c2\u8003\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u6ee1\u5206\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\uff082.8-2.9/3.0\uff09\uff1b43\u540d\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u63a5\u6536AI\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e94\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u62b5\u6297\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u9488\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u62b5\u6297\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709NLP\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u6539\u5584\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6280\u80fd\u3002"}}

Under review at RLC 2026", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $\u03b5$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8be5\u7279\u6027\u5728\u51f8\u805a\u5408\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\"\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u03b5-\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u4ef7\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u884c\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u51f8\u805a\u5408\u4e0d\u5c01\u95ed\u6027\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u51f8\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u5728\u504f\u659c\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u884c\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8001\u864e\u673a\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u884c\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u51f8\u805a\u5408\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u504f\u659c\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u4e5f\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u5148\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u63a2\u9488\u6761\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u79bb\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u4e0d\u88ab\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u51f8\u805a\u5408\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u9488\u6761\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u79bb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u88ab\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks.

Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators.

We present JALA, a pretraining framework that learns Jointly-Aligned Latent Actions. JALA bypasses full visual dynamic reconstruction, instead learns a predictive action embedding aligned with both inverse dynamics and real actions. This yields a transition-aware, behavior-centric latent space for learning from heterogeneous human data. We scale this approach with UniHand-Mix, a 7.5M video corpus (>2,000 hours) blending laboratory and in-the-wild footage.

The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u65e0\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u74f6\u9888\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cf\u5316\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u6027\uff1b2) \u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f3a\u5236\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u6f5c\u5728\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\uff1b3) \u65e0\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u8f85\u52a9\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We first establish highly proficient ASR and NMT components: a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m model achieved a state-of-the-art 2.72% CER on OpenSLR-54, and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT model reached a 28.32 BLEU score on the FLORES-200 benchmark. We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline. It establishes an optimized baseline and demonstrates a critical architectural insight for developing cascaded speech translation systems for similar low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u5f0f\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u70b9\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6807\u70b9\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684ASR\uff08Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548cNMT\uff08\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7684MarianMT\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u95f4\u6807\u70b9\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6700\u7ec8S2TT\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u70b9\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9BLEU\u4e0b\u964d20.7%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5728ASR\u8f93\u51fa\u540e\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528PRM\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f974.90 BLEU\u63d0\u5347\uff0836.38 vs 31.48\uff09\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u5145\u5206\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6807\u70b9\u6062\u590d\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bedS2TT\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6d1e\u5bdf\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Yet their real-world adoption is limited, partly due to non-intuitive trainer/therapist-trainee/patient interactions. To address this gap, we present a haptic teleoperation system for trainers to remotely guide and monitor the movements of a trainee wearing an arm exoskeleton. The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand. These findings support the feasibility of our proposed interface for effective remote human-robot physical interaction.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc799%\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u4f4e\u5e45\u503c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7279\u6027", "method": "\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u4f4e\u5e45\u503c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5197\u4f59\u6027", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5197\u4f59\uff1a\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc799%\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u8d85\u8fc799.9%\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5934\u90e8\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u4fee\u526a\u591a\u8fbe\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u540e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u673a\u4f1a"}}

Post-training sparsity (PTS), which reduces model cost by removing weights from dense networks, is an effective approach. However, native dense matrices lack high sparsity, making existing approaches that directly remove weights disrupt model states, resulting in unsatisfactory performance recovery even with post-tuning. We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead. At the feature level, we introduce Spectral Norm Loss to promote feature sparsity from a low-rank perspective.

Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u53ca", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u4e8b\u540e\u4fee\u6b63\u6216\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u89e6\u53d1\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u53ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u89e3\u7801\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u51cf\u5f31\u865a\u5047\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u865a\u5047\u7269\u4f53\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces.

In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%.

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise.

Although existing cross-tokenizer KD methods have made notable progress, their effectiveness remains constrained by suboptimal alignment across sequence and vocabulary levels. To address these limitations, we introduce Dual-Space Weighting and Time-Warped Alignment (DWA-KD), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that enhances token-wise distillation through dual-space entropy-based weighting and achieves precise sequence-level alignment by leveraging both lexical and semantic information. At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences. Extensive experiments across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that DWA-KD outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of entropy-based token weighting and embedding and final hidden state layer Soft-DTW alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "DWA-KD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u71b5\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8f6f\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728token\u7ea7\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316token\u7ea7\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDWA-KD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09token\u7ea7\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4KL\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u6743\u91cd\u5173\u6ce8\u5b66\u751f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u800c\u6559\u5e08\u786e\u5b9a\u7684token\uff1b2\uff09\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\uff1a\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5e94\u7528\u8f6f\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aNLP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDWA-KD\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684token\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42/\u6700\u7ec8\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8f6f\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "DWA-KD\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8f6f\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex large deformation tasks, especially those involving opposite curvatures, and lack efficiency and precision. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online visual servoing. In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation. It successfully completes all 30 cases with diverse initial and target shapes across DLOs of different sizes and materials.

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems.

Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniHand\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u90fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u4e3a\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniHand\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5d4c\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50MANO\u53c2\u6570\u548c2D\u9aa8\u67b6\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f16\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1b3) \u4e13\u7528\u624b\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u624b\u90e8\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b4) \u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniHand\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UniHand\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a4D\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts.

However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation.

In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion. These results highlight the importance of aligning architectural design with clinical interpretation workflows for robust and data-efficient 3D medical image analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f74\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e73\u9762\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u76843D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u4ee5\u8f74\u5411\u5e73\u9762\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728MedMNIST3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5e73\u9762\uff08\u8f74\u5411\u3001\u51a0\u72b6\u3001\u77e2\u72b6\uff09\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u91ca3D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8f74\u5411\u5e73\u9762\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u73b0\u67093D\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6574\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5e73\u9762\u8d4b\u4e88\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u8f74\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f74\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e73\u9762\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528MedDINOv3\uff08\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8f74\u5411CT\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5904\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e73\u9762\uff1b2\uff09RICA\u5757\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u5185Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u8f74\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e73\u9762Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u8f74\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u8865\u5145\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728MedMNIST3D\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cAUC\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u67093D\u548c\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8f74\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e-\u503c\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e73\u9762\u878d\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

First, RGS employs a vision--language model (VLM)-based gaze reasoning pipeline to infer context-appropriate gaze targets from multimodal interaction cues, ensuring consistency with human gaze-orienting regularities. Second, RGS introduces a conditional Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for eye--head coordinated gaze-shift motion generation, producing diverse and human-like gaze-shift behaviors. Experiments validate that RGS effectively replicates human-like target selection and generates realistic, diverse gaze-shift motions.", "AI": {"tldr": "RGS\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u89c6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6761\u4ef6VQ-VAE\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u773c\u5934\u534f\u8c03\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4eff\u751f\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRGS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a8\u65ad\u7b26\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6VQ-VAE\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u773c\u5934\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1RGS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u590d\u5236\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "RGS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6ce8\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

A further limitation is that existing methods only predict relations without providing any supporting explanations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities in both deep language understanding and natural language explanation generation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach to distill the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight IDRR models to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate explanations for each training instance conditioned on its gold label. Then, we introduce a novel classification-generation framework that jointly performs relation prediction and explanation generation, and train it with the additional supervision of LLM-generated explanations. Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability.

In this study, we propose Disciplined Chain-of-Thought (D-CoT), a novel framework that enforces a structured reasoning process using control tags -- such as <TEMP_LOW> for fact-checking and <TEMP_HIGH> for multi-perspective exploration -- as auxiliary scaffolding during training. By optimizing the CoT trajectory, D-CoT suppresses reasoning drift and simultaneously achieves token reduction and performance improvement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on Qwen3-8B: with only 5,000 training samples, D-CoT significantly boosts accuracy on GPQA-diamond by 9.9% and MMLU-Pro (0-shot) by 9.1%, while drastically reducing computational costs.

While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction.

In robot swarms, measurements from different robots arrive asynchronously and with clock time-offsets. Although Continuous-Time (CT) formulations have proved effective for handling asynchronous measurements in single-robot SLAM and calibration, extending CT methods to multi-robot settings faces great challenges to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency, and high-frequency performance. Especially, existing CT methods suffer from the inherent query-time delay of unclamped B-splines and high computational cost. This paper proposes CT-RIO, a novel Continuous-Time Relative-Inertial Odometry framework. We employ Clamped Non-Uniform B-splines (C-NUBS) to represent robot states for the first time, eliminating the query-time delay. We further augment C-NUBS with closed-form extension and shrinkage operations that preserve the spline shape, making it suitable for online estimation and enabling flexible knot management. This flexibility leads to the concept of knot-keyknot strategy, which supports spline extension at high-frequency while retaining sparse keyknots for adaptive relative-motion modeling. We then formulate a sliding-window relative localization problem that operates purely on relative kinematics and inter-robot constraints. To meet the demanding computation required at swarm scale, we decompose the tightly-coupled optimization into robot-wise sub-problems and solve them in parallel using incremental asynchronous block coordinate descent. Extensive experiments show that CT-RIO converges from time-offsets as large as 263 ms to sub-millisecond within 3 s, and achieves RMSEs of 0.046 m and 1.8 \u00b0.

Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition.

In this paper, we introduce FewMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs under few-shot conditions, with a focus on In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Covering a diverse suite of multimodal understanding tasks, from attribute recognition to temporal reasoning, FewMMBench enables systematic analysis across task types, model families, and prompting strategies. We evaluate 26 open-weight MLLMs from six model families across zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT-augmented few-shot settings. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuned models exhibit strong zero-shot performance but benefit minimally, or even regress, with additional demonstrations or CoT reasoning. Retrieval-based demonstrations and increased context size also yield limited gains.

Diverging from previous approaches, we introduce the first tri-modal masked diffusion model pretrained from scratch on text, image-text, and audio-text data. We systematically analyze multimodal scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects, and we provide optimized inference sampling defaults. Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks.

However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

As lifelogs grow over time, systems must also adapt quickly to newly accumulated data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, making them promising for personalized applications. In this work, we present a framework that leverages LLMs for proactive information access, integrating personal knowledge graphs to enhance the detection of access needs through a refined decision-making process.

Preliminary work", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

However, previous work mainly focuses on English reasoning in expectation of the strongest performance, despite the demonstrated potential advantage of multilingual thinking, as well as the requirement for native thinking traces by global users. In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ExpLang\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u601d\u7ef4\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u6539\u8fdbRL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u82f1\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u8ffd\u6c42\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u6bcd\u8bed\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faExpLang\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u4f5c\u4e3aRL\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5c55RL\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u82f1\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bf9\u5df2\u89c1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8bed\u8a00\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u601d\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u9075\u4ece\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u4e86RL\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "ExpLang\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5927\u591a\u6570RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting.

However, existing approaches struggle to achieve high accuracy under strict bandwidth constraints and remain highly vulnerable to random transmission packet loss. We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures.

We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification.

Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration.

We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods.

We employ a simulation-driven design optimization process to synthesize a spatial linkage topology with a focus on vertical jump height and momentum-based balancing on a single wheel contact. Using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of diverse athletic behaviors, including track-stands, jumps, wheelies, rear wheel hopping, and front flips. This 23.5 kg robot is capable of high speeds (8 m/s) and jumping on and over large obstacles (1 m tall, or 130% of the robot's nominal height).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d7\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0UMV\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5c71\u5730\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u548c\u6280\u5de7\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6210\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u6746\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5782\u76f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565", "result": "23.5\u516c\u65a4\u7684UMV\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u539f\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u7fd8\u8f6e\u3001\u540e\u8f6e\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u524d\u7a7a\u7ffb\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe8\u7c73/\u79d2\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8df3\u8fc71\u7c73\u9ad8\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u654f\u6377\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

However, rapid advances in generation have outpaced automated quality assessment. Existing models emphasize generic esthetics or low level distortions and lack the functional criteria required for e-commerce design. It is especially challenging for Chinese content, where complex characters often produce subtle but critical textual artifacts that are overlooked by existing methods. To address this, we introduce E-comIQ-ZH, a framework for evaluating Chinese e-commerce posters. We build the first dataset E-comIQ-18k to feature multi dimensional scores and expert calibrated Chain of Thought (CoT) rationales. Using this dataset, we train E-comIQ-M, a specialized evaluation model that aligns with human expert judgment. Our framework enables E-comIQ-Bench, the first automated and scalable benchmark for the generation of Chinese e-commerce posters. Extensive experiments show our E-comIQ-M aligns more closely with expert standards and enables scalable automated assessment of e-commerce posters.

This paper presents a position-based flocking model that achieves persistent velocity alignment without velocity sensing. By approximating relative velocity differences from changes between current and initial relative positions and incorporating a time- and density-dependent alignment gain with a non-zero minimum threshold to maintain persistent alignment, the model sustains coherent collective motion over extended periods. Simulations with a collective of 50 agents demonstrate that the position-based flocking model attains faster and more sustained directional alignment and results in more compact formations than a velocity-alignment-based baseline. This position-based flocking model is particularly well-suited for real-world robotic swarms, where velocity measurements are unreliable, noisy, or unavailable.

For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "SF3D-RGB\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u54082D\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u6216LiDAR\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784SF3D-RGB\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u522b\u7f16\u78012D\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u6620\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u573a\u666f\u6d41\uff1b4\uff09\u6b8b\u5dee\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SF3D-RGB\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u54082D\u548c3D\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We introduce MEDSYN, a multilingual, multimodal benchmark of highly complex clinical cases with up to 7 distinct visual clinical evidence (CE) types per case. Mirroring clinical workflow, we evaluate 18 MLLMs on differential diagnosis (DDx) generation and final diagnosis (FDx) selection. While top models often match or even outperform human experts on DDx generation, all MLLMs exhibit a much larger DDx--FDx performance gap compared to expert clinicians, indicating a failure mode in synthesis of heterogeneous CE types. Ablations attribute this failure to (i) overreliance on less discriminative textual CE ($\\it{e.g.}$, medical history) and (ii) a cross-modal CE utilization gap. We introduce Evidence Sensitivity to quantify the latter and show that a smaller gap correlates with higher diagnostic accuracy.

To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations.

Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects.

Through in-depth analysis of LVLM activation patterns, we reveal two key findings: 1) truthfulness and visual perception capabilities predominantly engage different subsets of attention heads within the model architecture; and 2) truthfulness steering vectors vary significantly across different semantic contexts. Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach significantly enhances model performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u6700\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff1b4\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u6700\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing benchmarks focus on judging grammatical acceptability, whereas the ability to interpret meanings conveyed by grammatical forms has received much less attention. We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CxMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6784\u5f0f\uff08\u5f62\u5f0f-\u610f\u4e49\u914d\u5bf9\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u53e5\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6784\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u53d1\u5c55\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f62\u5f0f\u6240\u4f20\u8fbe\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6784\u5f0f\uff08construction\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6784\u5f0f\u8bed\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CxMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u6700\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e5d\u79cd\u6784\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62eclet-alone\u3001\u81f4\u4f7f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u53cc\u53ca\u7269\u7b49\u6784\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6784\u5f0f\u9690\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u53e5\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6784\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u610f\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "CxMP\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u610f\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing AI systems offer binary safety verification or static detection, ignoring the phase-dependent nature of intraoperative reasoning. We introduce ResGo, a benchmark of laparoscopic frames annotated with Go Zone bounding boxes and clinician-authored rationales covering phase, exposure quality reasoning, next action and risk reminder. We introduce evaluation metrics that treat correct grounding under incorrect phase as failures, revealing that most vision-language models cannot handle such tasks and perform poorly. We then present SurGo-R1, a model optimized via RLHF with a multi-turn phase-then-go architecture where the model first identifies the surgical phase, then generates reasoning and Go Zone coordinates conditioned on that context. On unseen procedures, SurGo-R1 achieves 76.6% phase accuracy, 32.7 mIoU, and 54.8% hardcore accuracy, a 6.6$\\times$ improvement over the mainstream generalist VLMs. Code, model and benchmark will be available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/SurGo-R1", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResGo\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cSurGo-R1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u867d\u7136\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u9759\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u672f\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165ResGo\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8179\u8154\u955c\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bf4\u660e\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faSurGo-R1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u5148\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\"\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u5750\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0a\uff0cSurGo-R1\u8fbe\u523076.6%\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300132.7 mIoU\u548c54.8%\u7684\u786c\u6838\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53476.6\u500d\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7ResGo\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSurGo-R1\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u672fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches require additional training for each set of objectives, limiting their applicability and incurring substantial computational overhead. We propose a training-free mixing policy that composes pre-trained GFlowNets at inference time, enabling rapid adaptation without finetuning or retraining. Importantly, our framework is flexible, capable of handling diverse reward combinations ranging from linear scalarization to complex non-linear logical operators, which are often handled separately in previous literature. We prove that our method exactly recovers the target distribution for linear scalarization and quantify the approximation quality for nonlinear operators through a distortion factor.

A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91.

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function.

However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.\n  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7259\u9f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7531\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7259\u9f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7259\u9f7f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5728OralVision\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4(mIoU)\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7259\u9f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability.

This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features.

We propose a confidence-driven strategy that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on confidence estimates. By assessing a model's confidence in handling the task and response accuracy, tasks that are likely to be solved correctly are retained, while more uncertain or complex cases are delegated to a larger model, ensuring reliability while minimizing computation. Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate. Experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to the largest model while reducing computational costs by 20\\% to 40\\%. When applied to GPT-4o API calls, it reduces token usage by approximately 60\\%, further improving cost efficiency.

Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u7684CSI\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u7248\u6743\u5206\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u6eaf\u6e90\u548c\u9632\u4f2a\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u5c42\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6613\u53d7\u53cd\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u867d\u7136\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u6c34\u5370\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSI\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7834\u574f\u6c34\u5370\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment.

We introduce IndicIFEval, a benchmark evaluating constrained generation of LLMs across 14 Indic languages using automatically verifiable, rule-based instructions. It comprises around 800 human-verified examples per language spread across two complementary subsets: IndicIFEval-Ground, translated prompts from IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023) carefully localized for Indic contexts, and IndicIFEval-Ground, synthetically generated instructions grounded in native Indic content. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of major open-weight and proprietary models spanning both reasoning and non-reasoning models. While models maintain strong adherence to formatting constraints, they struggle significantly with lexical and cross-lingual tasks -- and despite progress in high-resource languages, instruction-following across the broader Indic family lags significantly behind English.

By decoupling logical operators from query topologies, NGDB-Zoo transforms the training loop into a dynamically scheduled data-flow execution, enabling multi-stream parallelism and achieving a $1.8\\times$ - $6.8\\times$ throughput compared to baselines. Furthermore, we formalize a decoupled architecture to integrate high-dimensional semantic priors from Pre-trained Text Encoders (PTEs) without triggering I/O stalls or memory overflows.

Existing image-to-image translation methods, which use depth as a posterior constraint, often produce structural distortions and specular highlights by failing to balance realism with structure consistency. To address this, we propose a Structure-to-Image paradigm that transforms the depth map from a passive constraint into an active generative foundation. We are the first to introduce phase congruency to colonoscopic domain adaptation and design a cross-level structure constraint to co-optimize geometric structures and fine-grained details like vascular textures. In zero-shot evaluations conducted on a publicly available phantom dataset, the MDE model that was fine-tuned on our generated data achieved a maximum reduction of 44.18% in RMSE compared to competing methods.

We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversational context. Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting. Results demonstrate that the system successfully adapts its personality state to user inputs, but also influences user behavior, thereby facilitating de-escalation training. Notably, the scoring pipeline maintains comparable precision even when utilizing lightweight, fine-tuned classifiers instead of large-scale LLMs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of modular, personality-adaptive architectures for education, customer support, and broader human-computer interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u8868\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u4eba\u683c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8f6c\u6362\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u683c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u4e92", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4eba\u683c\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u683c\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u8868\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u4eba\u683c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u6982\u7387\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff1b2) \u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u8bc4\u5206\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6cbf\u6f5c\u5728\u8f74\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u6216LLM\uff1b3) \u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4eba\u9645\u73af\u72b6\u6a21\u578b(IPC)\uff1a1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u8c03\u6574\u4eba\u683c\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2) \u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u964d\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u8bc4\u5206\u7ba1\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u4eba\u683c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group.

Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows. In practice, models often struggle to keep attention aligned with the most relevant context throughout decoding. In this work, we propose DySCO, a novel decoding algorithm for improving long-context reasoning. DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute. Further analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic attention rescaling and retrieval-head-guided selection for the effectiveness of the method, while providing interpretability insights into decoding-time attention behavior.

In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics.

Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings.

For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple \"think step-by-step\" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math.

The primary challenge remains scaling to larger models, in particular in the presence of many possible inputs to the system. Modern AAL algorithms fail to scale even if, in every state, most inputs lead to errors. In various challenging problems from the literature, these errors are observable, i.e., they emit a known error output. Motivated by these problems, we study learning these systems more efficiently. Further, we consider various degrees of knowledge about which inputs are non-error producing at which state. For each level of knowledge, we provide a matching adaptation of the state-of-the-art AAL algorithm L# to make the most of this domain knowledge.

Thanks to visionary digital Assyriology projects such as ETCSL, CDLI, and Oracc, a large number of Sumerian transliterations have been published online, and these data are well-structured for a variety of search and analysis tasks. However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.\n  To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc. We construct SumTablets by first preprocessing and standardizing the Oracc transliterations before mapping each reading back to the Unicode representation of the source glyph. Further, we retain parallel structural information (e.g., surfaces, newlines, broken segments) through the use of special tokens. We release SumTablets as a Hugging Face Dataset (CC BY 4.0) and open source data preparation code via GitHub.\n  Additionally, we leverage SumTablets to implement and evaluate two transliteration baselines: (1) weighted sampling from a glyph's possible readings, and (2) fine-tuning an autoregressive language model. Our fine-tuned language model achieves an average transliteration character-level F-score (chrF) of 97.55, demonstrating the immediate potential of transformer-based transliteration models in allowing experts to rapidly verify generated transliterations rather than manually transliterating tablets one-by-one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SumTablets\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0691,606\u5757\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u677f\u7684Unicode\u8868\u793a\u4e0eOracc\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u97f3\u8bd1\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u97f3\u8bd1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u97f3\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u97f3\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7ebf\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u97f3\u8bd1\u4e0e\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u97f3\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316Oracc\u97f3\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bfb\u97f3\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u6e90\u7b26\u53f7\u7684Unicode\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5e73\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u8868\u9762\u3001\u6362\u884c\u3001\u65ad\u88c2\u6bb5\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b91,606\u5757\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u677f\uff08\u603b\u8ba16,970,407\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\u7684SumTablets\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u5e03SumTablets\u4f5c\u4e3aHugging Face\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CC BY 4.0\u8bb8\u53ef\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u97f3\u8bd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u52a0\u6743\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8697.55\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7F\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SumTablets\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u82cf\u7f8e\u5c14\u6954\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u97f3\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e13\u5bb6\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u624b\u52a8\u9010\u5757\u97f3\u8bd1\u3002"}}

We propose the Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC) - inspired by natural emerging distributions in team structures, where following high-level objectives combines with low-level execution. HLC demonstrates that introducing multiple hierarchies, leveraging local and global perspectives, can lead to improved performance with high sample efficiency and robust policies. Experimental results conducted on cooperative, non-communicative, and partially observable MARL benchmarks demonstrate that HLC outperforms single hierarchy baselines and scales robustly with increasing amounts of agents and difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784HLC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u534f\u540c\u4efb\u52a1", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08HLC\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d7\u81ea\u7136\u56e2\u961f\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a", "result": "HLC\u5728\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u975e\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42\u6b21\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84"}}

To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone.

However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "TiMi\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7d27\u6025\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u516c\u544a\uff09\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTiMi\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff08MMoE\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u8d4b\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "conclusion": "TiMi\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548cMMoE\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u65e0\u5bf9\u9f50\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b"}}

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u5584\u7269\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u6570\u636e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u635f\u5931\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications.

However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "C\u00b2TC\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c112\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5de5\u4e1a\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7ed9\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC\u00b2TC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7c7b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898(CCAP)\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6602\u8d35\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1HFILS\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7c7b\u5185\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faHCFE\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u79bb\u6563\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC\u00b2TC\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c112\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b2TC\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $\u03c0^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model.

Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\"\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\"\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\uff09\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u5230PLMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u6837\uff08\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u6269\u6563\uff09\u4e14\u6709\u4e9b\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684", "method": "\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684PLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u5c42\u8d21\u732e\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u6df1\u5c42\u8f83\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e9\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7cbe\u70bc\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u66f4\u6df1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e", "conclusion": "PLMs\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u673a"}}

The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models.

While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemVideo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u7684fMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SemMiner\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dfMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1\uff09\u8de8\u5e27\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b2\uff09\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u5e27\u95f4\u7a81\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4ece\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemVideo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fSemMiner\u5206\u5c42\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u523a\u6fc0\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u951a\u70b9\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u5411\u53d9\u8ff0\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6458\u8981\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5c06fMRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0eCLIP\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u65b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728CC2017\u548cHCP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemVideo\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3afMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "SemVideo\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86fMRI\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Unlike ray tracing, which requires full 3D reconstruction, LGI captures essential light-shadow interactions reliably and accurately, computed from off-the-shelf 2.5D depth map predictions. LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning. To enable effective training, we curated the first large-scale benchmark dataset for joint shadow and relighting, covering reflections, transparency, and complex interreflections.

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCUPID\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\"\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u9510\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u5f53\u8bd5\u56fe\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\"\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9057\u5fd8\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u9057\u5fd8\u504f\u7f6e\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u7c7b\u522b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCUPID\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u9510\u5ea6\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b2) \u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u8def\u5f84\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u8def\u7531\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0", "result": "\u5728Waterbirds\u3001BAR\u548cBiased NICO++\u7b49\u6709\u504f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "CUPID\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Excitation\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5236\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982MoE\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6MoE\u4e2d\u7684\"\u7ed3\u6784\u6df7\u6dc6\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u5982\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff08MoE\uff09\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6MoE\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u7ed3\u6784\u6df7\u6dc6\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "Excitation\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6279\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff1a\u653e\u5927\u9ad8\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u8def\u7531\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cExcitation\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u80fd\"\u62ef\u6551\"\u6df1\u5ea6MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e3b\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5236\u662f\u6709\u6548\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "Excitation\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve.

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis.

To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \\underline{\\textbf{s}}ingle \\underline{\\textbf{r}}andom \\underline{\\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \\underline{\\textbf{meta}}-learning with \\underline{\\textbf{f}}eature \\underline{\\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\\%, 4.71\\%, and 2.38\\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMeta-FC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u968f\u673a\u5931\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u968f\u673a\u5931\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6279\u6b21\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u5c42\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u5931\u771f\u7c7b\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5931\u771f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6279\u6b21\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMeta-FC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6c60\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u6784\u5efa\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\"\u672a\u77e5\"\u5931\u771f\u7528\u4e8e\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u7ea6\u675f\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u5931\u771f\u540e\u89e3\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u968f\u673a\u5931\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0cMeta-FC\u5728\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5931\u771f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.59%\u30014.71%\u548c2.38%\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta-FC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion.

Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input.

However, the explanations generated by most CE generators are often highly redundant. This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting.

However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea63.6%", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u5411\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9891\u7e41\u4f20\u8f93\u9020\u6210\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6355\u83b7\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528Bhattacharyya\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u878d\u5408\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u89e3\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u79ef\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGFPL\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.6%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "GFPL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task.

Empowering Users with Actionable Feedback", "comment": "Accepted @ CVPR 2026. Project page: https://laitifranz.github.io/MemCoach/", "summary": "Image memorability, i.e., how likely an image is to be remembered, has traditionally been studied in computer vision either as a passive prediction task, with models regressing a scalar score, or with generative methods altering the visual input to boost the image likelihood of being remembered. Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., \"emphasize facial expression,\" \"bring the subject forward\"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMemFeed\u4efb\u52a1\u548cMemCoach\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MLLM\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MemBench\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u88ab\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fee\u6539\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u5728\u62cd\u6444\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u7167\u7247\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u672a\u6765\u56de\u5fc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemCoach\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6700\u4e0d\u6613\u8bb0\u5230\u6700\u6613\u8bb0\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMemCoach\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u521b\u5efa\u4e86MemBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7167\u7247\u62cd\u6444\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6559\u5bfc\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}

Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments.

Conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) have been the most popular variant but struggle to effectively navigate the risk-utility trade-off. Bayesian GAN have received less attention for tabular data, but have been explored with unstructured data such as images and text. The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase. We demonstrate that GACTGAN yields better synthetic data compared to CTGAN, achieving better preservation of tabular structure and inferential statistics with less privacy risk. These results highlight GACTGAN as a simpler, effective implementation of Bayesian tabular synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGACTGAN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672fSWAG\u96c6\u6210\u5230CTGAN\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4CTGAN\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "CTGAN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u98ce\u9669-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afGAN\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u7528\u7684MCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u52bf\u53c8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGACTGAN\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747-\u9ad8\u65af(SWAG)\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u5230CTGAN\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e2d\u3002SWAG\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u6743\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "GACTGAN\u76f8\u6bd4CTGAN\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8868\u683c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "GACTGAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210SWAG\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u98ce\u9669-\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers. Elevation, land cover, meteorological variables, and cloud-free reference images are included to help reduce surface-cloud ambiguity and cloud formation uncertainty. To overcome the scarcity of manual cloud labels, we include a large set of samples with automated cloud masks and a smaller manually annotated subset to further evaluate and improve models.

Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context\". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence.

At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification.

It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixed-SuStaIn through simulation experiments and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, showing that it performs well on mixed datasets.

However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity.

Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.\n  We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.\n  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.\n  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.", "AI": {"tldr": "PatchDenoiser\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8epatch\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89e3\u5256\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u3001GAN\u548ctransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e38\u56e0\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u8fd0\u52a8\u6216\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u9650\u5236\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CNN\u3001GAN\u3001transformer\uff09\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPatchDenoiser\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684patch\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u57282016 Mayo\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPatchDenoiser\u5728PSNR\u548cSSIM\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684CNN\u548cGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u5207\u7247\u539a\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u6838\u548cHU\u7a97\u53e3\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea69\u500d\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea627\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PatchDenoiser\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning. Extensive experimental results on MFIDDR, by far the largest multi-view fundus image dataset, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches in diabetic retinopathy grading.", "AI": {"tldr": "MVGFDR\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u529b\u4e27\u5931\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7ea7\u5bf9\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5e7f\u89c6\u91ce\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u878d\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u60a3\u8005\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMVGFDR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fde\u63a5\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DCT\u7cfb\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9891\u57df\u951a\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6574\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u63a9\u7801\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6MFIDDR\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MVGFDR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as VLM's widely used reasoning strategy, is facing critical challenges. Existing textual CoT has a large gap between text semantic space and trajectory physical space. Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data.

Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios.

In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound.

However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of \"trigger word-target image\" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%.

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies.

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization.

However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "RobustVisRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u9000\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5931\u771f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u9634\u5f71\u7b49\u5931\u771f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f1a\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u9000\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u90fd\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRobustVisRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u83b7\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7eaf\u51c0\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u5931\u771f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cRobustVisRAG\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.35%\u30016.35%\u548c12.40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RobustVisRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5931\u771f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce Olbedo, a large-scale aerial dataset for outdoor albedo--shading decomposition in the wild. Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes. These annotations are derived from an inverse-rendering refinement pipeline over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination, together with per-pixel confidence masks. We demonstrate that Olbedo enables state-of-the-art diffusion-based IID models, originally trained on synthetic indoor data, to generalize to real outdoor imagery: fine-tuning on Olbedo significantly improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on the MatrixCity benchmark. We further illustrate applications of Olbedo-trained models to multi-view consistent relighting of 3D assets, material editing, and scene change analysis for urban digital twins.

Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception. Extensive experiments on the RefRT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTrack framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRT-RMOT\u4efb\u52a1\u548cRTrack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408RGB\u548c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5929\u5019\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aRGB-\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6RefRT\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5728\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u591c\u95f4\u3001\u70df\u96fe\u7b49\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u878d\u5408RGB\u5916\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u7167\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5929\u5019\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRTrack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210RGB\u3001\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(GSPO)\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u88c1\u526a\u4f18\u52bf\u7f29\u653e(CAS)\u7b56\u7565\u6291\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2aRGB-\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6RefRT\uff0c\u5305\u542b388\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u30011,250\u4e2a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76ee\u6807\u548c166,147\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00-RGB-\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b\u5728RefRT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RTrack\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408RGB\u548c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5929\u5019\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RTrack\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

To IEEE SaTML 2026", "summary": "Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers\" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks.

However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing.

Unlike generalist 3D medical VLMs, \\textbf{Brain3D} is tailored to neuroradiology, where hemispheric laterality, tumor infiltration patterns, and anatomical localization are critical. Evaluated on 468 subjects (BraTS pathological cases plus healthy controls), our model achieves a Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 versus 0.413 for a strong 2D baseline while maintaining perfect specificity on healthy scans. The staged alignment proves essential: contrastive grounding establishes visual-textual correspondence, projector warmup stabilizes conditioning, and LoRA adaptation shifts output from verbose captions to structured clinical reports\\footnote{Our code is publicly available for transparency and reproducibility", "AI": {"tldr": "Brain3D\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D\u8111\u80bf\u7624MRI\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c062D\u533b\u5b66\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u539f\u751f3D\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4f53\u79ef\u8111MRI\u65f6\u91c7\u75282D\u5207\u7247\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u795e\u7ecf\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5927\u8111\u534a\u7403\u504f\u4fa7\u6027\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u6d78\u6da6\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5b9a\u4f4d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76842D\u533b\u5b66\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u539f\u751f3D\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728468\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\uff08BraTS\u75c5\u7406\u75c5\u4f8b\u52a0\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u7406F1\u5206\u65700.951\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a2D\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ec5\u4e3a0.413\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "Brain3D\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece3D\u8111\u80bf\u7624MRI\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u4ece\u5197\u957f\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u3002"}}

Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoLoGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u6210\u9700\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5f3a\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6982\u5ff5-\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoLoGen\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u540c\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6e10\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7ec7\uff08PRW\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u4e13\u95e8\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6574\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoLoGen\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CoLoGen\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8c03\u548c\u6982\u5ff5-\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u793a\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model.

The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors.

At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step. We explore a design space for pretraining the proposed mixed-magnification region aggregators and evaluate our models on transfer to biomarker prediction tasks representing various cancer types.

We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher.

Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction.

Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neu-PiG\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u9690\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u65e0\u6f02\u79fb\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u60013D\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u589e\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6f02\u79fb\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u65e0\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u9690\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u7684Neu-PiG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9690\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b2\uff09\u7f51\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7Sobolev\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b4\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5e27\u76846\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeu-PiG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6bd4\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb60\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91cd\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6570\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u65e0\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "Neu-PiG\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u9690\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u65e0\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u6216\u989d\u5916\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u90fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
