Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

However, limited awareness of existing task-specific resources in low-resource languages hinders research. This challenge is especially acute in linguistically diverse countries, such as India. Cross-task profiling of existing Indian speech datasets can alleviate the data scarcity challenge. This involves investigating the utility of datasets across multiple downstream tasks rather than focusing on a single task. Prior surveys typically catalogue datasets for a single task, leaving comprehensive cross-task profiling as an open opportunity. Therefore, we propose Task-Lens, a cross-task survey that assesses the readiness of 50 Indian speech datasets spanning 26 languages for nine downstream speech tasks. First, we analyze which datasets contain metadata and properties suitable for specific tasks. Next, we propose task-aligned enhancements to unlock datasets to their full downstream potential. Finally, we identify tasks and Indian languages that are critically underserved by current resources. Our findings reveal that many Indian speech datasets contain untapped metadata that can support multiple downstream tasks. By uncovering cross-task linkages and gaps, Task-Lens enables researchers to explore the broader applicability of existing datasets and to prioritize dataset creation for underserved tasks and languages."}

Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models."}

A Benchmark for Verifying Scientific References in the LLM Era", "comment": null, "summary": "Scientific research relies on accurate citation for attribution and integrity, yet large language models (LLMs) introduce a new risk: fabricated references that appear plausible but correspond to no real publications. Such hallucinated citations have already been observed in submissions and accepted papers at major machine learning venues, exposing vulnerabilities in peer review. Meanwhile, rapidly growing reference lists make manual verification impractical, and existing automated tools remain fragile to noisy and heterogeneous citation formats and lack standardized evaluation. We present the first comprehensive benchmark and detection framework for hallucinated citations in scientific writing. Our multi-agent verification pipeline decomposes citation checking into claim extraction, evidence retrieval, passage matching, reasoning, and calibrated judgment to assess whether a cited source truly supports its claim. We construct a large-scale human-validated dataset across domains and define unified metrics for citation faithfulness and evidence alignment. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial citation errors and show that our framework significantly outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and interpretability.

In this work, we propose two constraint-driven training frameworks with guarantees for supermartingale-based neural certificate construction and controller synthesis for SDEs. The first approach enforces certificate inequalities via domain discretization and a bound-based loss, guaranteeing global validity once the loss reaches zero. We show that this method also enables joint NN controller-certificate synthesis with hard guarantees. For high-dimensional systems where discretization becomes prohibitive, we introduce a partition-free, scenario-based training method that provides arbitrarily tight PAC guarantees for certificate constraint satisfaction. Benchmarks demonstrate scalability of the bound-based method up to 5D, outperforming the state of the art, and scalability of the scenario-based approach to at least 10D with high-confidence guarantees."}

While recent layout generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they frequently fail to align with nuanced human aesthetic judgment. Existing preference datasets and reward models trained on text-to-image generation do not generalize to layout evaluation, where the spatial arrangement of identical elements determines quality. To address this critical gap, we introduce DesignSense-10k, a large-scale dataset of 10,235 human-annotated preference pairs for graphic layout evaluation. We propose a five-stage curation pipeline that generates visually coherent layout transformations across diverse aspect ratios, using semantic grouping, layout prediction, filtering, clustering, and VLM-based refinement to produce high-quality comparison pairs. Human preferences are annotated using a 4-class scheme (left, right, both good, both bad) to capture subjective ambiguity. Leveraging this dataset, we train DesignSense, a vision-language model-based classifier that substantially outperforms existing open-source and proprietary models across comprehensive evaluation metrics (54.6% improvement in Macro F1 over the strongest proprietary baseline). Our analysis shows that frontier VLMs remain unreliable overall and fail catastrophically on the full four-class task, underscoring the need for specialized, preference-aware models. Beyond the dataset, our reward model DesignSense yields tangible downstream gains in layout generation. Using our judge during RL based training improves generator win rate by about 3%, while inference-time scaling, which involves generating multiple candidates and selecting the best one, provides a 3.6% improvement. These results highlight the practical impact of specialized, layout-aware preference modeling on real-world layout generation quality."}

Prior defenses, based on applications of DPO, NPO, and similar algorithms, reduce the likelihood of harmful continuations, but not robustly so: they are vulnerable to adversarial prompting and easily undone by fine-tuning-based relearning attacks. Indeed, research has shown that these edits to the model are superficial: linear probing reveals that harmful \"directions\" remain present in representations. To address this, we propose Representation Erasure-based Preference Optimization (REPO), reformulating detoxification as a token-level preference problem. Using a novel objective with preference data, we force the representations of toxic continuations to converge toward their benign counterparts. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that this granular approach is critical: unlike baselines, REPO induces deep, localized edits to toxicity-encoding neurons while preserving general model utility. Exhaustive evaluations show that REPO achieves state-of-the-art robustness, stopping sophisticated threats-including relearning attacks and enhanced GCG jailbreaks-where existing representation- and output-based methods fail."}

Traditional detection algorithms generally struggle with predictions under dynamic waveform scenarios. This research provides our approach of using a unique data-driven linearization (DDL) framework for early prediction of HIAFs, giving both interpretability and scalability. The proposed method translates nonlinear current waveforms into a linearized space using coordinate embeddings and polynomial transformation, enabling precise modelling of fault precursors.The total duration of the test waveform is 0.5 seconds, within which the arc fault occurs between 0.2 seconds to 0.3 seconds. Our proposed approach using DDL, trained solely on the pre-fault healthy region (0.10 seconds to 0.18 seconds) effectively captures certain invisible fault precursors, to accurately predict the onset of fault at 0.189 seconds, which is approximately 0.011 seconds (i.e., 11 milliseconds) earlier than the actual fault occurrence. In particular, the framework predicts the start of arc faults at 0.189 seconds, significantly earlier of the actual fault incidence at 0.200 seconds, demonstrating substantial early warning capability. Performance evaluation comprises eigenvalue analysis, prediction error measures, error growth rate and waveform regeneration fidelity. Such early prediction proves that the model is capable of correctly foreseeing faults which is especially helpful in preventing real-world faults and accidents. It confirms that our proposed approach reliably predicts arc faults in medium-voltage power distribution systems"}

To address this ambiguity, we conducted a large-scale and systematic empirical study, confirming that the action space does have significant and complex impacts on robotic policy learning. We dissect the action design space along temporal and spatial axes, facilitating a structured analysis of how these choices govern both policy learnability and control stability.

The sampling of object behaviours, and the labelling of anomalously-acting objects, is a statistical process following central limit theorem principles.

To address this, we propose Utility-aware Contrastive AttenuatioN (U-CAN), a precision unlearning framework that operates on low-rank adapters. U-CAN quantifies risk by contrasting activations and focuses on neurons with asymmetric responses that are highly sensitive to the forgetting set but suppressed on the retention set. To safeguard performance, we introduce a utility-aware calibration mechanism that combines weight magnitudes with retention-set activation norms, assigning higher utility scores to dimensions that contribute strongly to retention performance. Unlike binary pruning, which often fragments network structure, U-CAN develop adaptive soft attenuation with a differentiable decay function to selectively down-scale high-risk parameters on LoRA adapters, suppressing sensitive retrieval pathways and preserving the topological connectivity of reasoning circuits. Experiments on two public datasets across seven metrics demonstrate that U-CAN achieves strong privacy forgetting, utility retention, and computational efficiency."}

However, existing proactive forensics methods typically treat deepfake detection, tampering localization, and source tracing as independent tasks, lacking a unified framework to address them jointly. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified proactive forensics framework that jointly addresses these three core tasks. Our core framework adopts an innovative 152-dimensional landmark-identity watermark termed LIDMark, which structurally interweaves facial landmarks with a unique source identifier. To robustly extract the LIDMark, we design a novel Factorized-Head Decoder (FHD). Its architecture factorizes the shared backbone features into two specialized heads (i.e., regression and classification), robustly reconstructing the embedded landmarks and identifier, respectively, even when subjected to severe distortion or tampering. This design realizes an \"all-in-one\" trifunctional forensic solution: the regression head underlies an \"intrinsic-extrinsic\" consistency check for detection and localization, while the classification head robustly decodes the source identifier for tracing. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LIDMark framework provides a unified, robust, and imperceptible solution for the detection, localization, and tracing of deepfake content.

For unary fixed-frequency encodings, circuit depth scales as O(omega_max * (omega_max + epsilon^{-2})) with target frequency magnitude omega_max and precision epsilon. Trainable-frequency approaches theoretically reduce this to match the target spectrum size, requiring only as many encoding gates as frequencies in the target spectrum. Despite this compelling efficiency, their practical effectiveness hinges on a key assumption: that gradient-based optimization can drive prefactors to arbitrary target values. We demonstrate through systematic experiments that frequency prefactors exhibit limited trainability: movement is constrained to approximately +/-1 units with typical learning rates. When target frequencies lie outside this reachable range, optimization frequently fails. To overcome this frequency reachability limitation, we propose grid-based initialization using ternary encodings, which generate dense integer frequency spectra. While this approach requires O(log_3(omega_max)) encoding gates -- more than the theoretical optimum but exponentially fewer than fixed-frequency methods -- it ensures target frequencies lie within the locally reachable range.

However, recent work (Raghavan & Bareinboim, 2025) has formally characterized a family of counterfactual distributions which can be directly estimated via experimental methods - a notion they call $\\textit{counterfactual realizabilty}$. This leaves open the question of what $\\textit{additional}$ counterfactual quantities now become identifiable, given this new access to (some) Layer 3 data. To answer this question, we develop the CTFIDU+ algorithm for identifying counterfactual queries from an arbitrary set of Layer 3 distributions, and prove that it is complete for this task. Building on this, we establish the theoretical limit of which counterfactuals can be identified from physically realizable distributions, thus implying the $\\textit{fundamental limit to exact causal inference in the non-parametric setting}$. Finally, given the impossibility of identifying certain critical types of counterfactuals, we derive novel analytic bounds for such quantities using realizable counterfactual data, and corroborate using simulations that counterfactual data helps tighten the bounds for non-identifiable quantities in practice."}

In its simplest form, this involves making an inference that is not strictly entailed by a premise, but rather only likely given the premise. While reasoning LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on logical and mathematical tasks, their behavior on such open-ended, non-deterministic inferences remains largely unexplored. We introduce ProbCOPA, a dataset of 210 handcrafted probabilistic inferences in English, each annotated for inference likelihood by 25--30 human participants. We find that human responses are graded and varied, revealing probabilistic judgments of the inferences in our dataset. Comparing these judgments with responses from eight state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, we show that models consistently fail to produce human-like distributions. Finally, analyzing LLM reasoning chains, we find evidence of a common reasoning pattern used to evaluate such inferences. Our findings reveal persistent differences between humans and LLMs, and underscore the need to evaluate reasoning beyond deterministic settings."}

In this study, FaultXformer is proposed, a Transformer encoder-based architecture developed for automatic fault analysis using real-time current data obtained from phasor measurement unit (PMU). The approach utilizes time-series current data to initially extract rich temporal information in stage 1, which is crucial for identifying the fault type and precisely determining its location across multiple nodes. In Stage 2, these extracted features are processed to differentiate among distinct fault types and identify the respective fault location within the distribution system. Thus, this dual-stage transformer encoder pipeline enables high-fidelity representation learning, considerably boosting the performance of the work. The model was validated on a dataset generated from the IEEE 13-node test feeder, simulated with 20 separate fault locations and several DER integration scenarios, utilizing current measurements from four strategically located PMUs. To demonstrate robust performance evaluation, stratified 10-fold cross-validation is performed. FaultXformer achieved average accuracies of 98.76% in fault type classification and 98.92% in fault location identification across cross-validation, consistently surpassing conventional deep learning baselines convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN). long short-term memory (LSTM) by 1.70%, 34.95%, and 2.04% in classification accuracy and by 10.82%, 40.89%, and 6.27% in location accuracy, respectively.

While Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability provides a formal method for synthesizing safe value functions, it scales poorly and is typically performed offline, limiting its applicability in dynamic environments. This paper bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online adaptation. We introduce refineCBF for refining an approximate CBF - whether analytically derived, learned, or even unsafe - via warm-started HJ reachability. We then present its computationally efficient successor, HJ-Patch, which accelerates this process through localized updates. Both methods guarantee the recovery of a safe value function and can ensure monotonic safety improvements during adaptation. Our experiments validate our framework's primary contribution: in-the-loop, real-time adaptation, in simulation (with detailed value function analysis) and on physical hardware. Our experiments on ground vehicles and quadcopters show that our framework can successfully adapt to sudden environmental changes, such as new obstacles and unmodeled wind disturbances, providing a practical path toward deploying formally guaranteed safety in real-world settings."}

SVG2 contains over 636K videos with 6.6M objects, 52.0M attributes, and 6.7M relations, providing an order-of-magnitude increase in scale and diversity over prior spatio-temporal scene graph datasets. To create SVG2, we design a fully automated pipeline that combines multi-scale panoptic segmentation, online-offline trajectory tracking with automatic new-object discovery, per-trajectory semantic parsing, and GPT-5-based spatio-temporal relation inference. Building on this resource, we train TRaSER, a video scene graph generation model. TRaSER augments VLMs with a trajectory-aligned token arrangement mechanism and new modules: an object-trajectory resampler and a temporal-window resampler to convert raw videos and panoptic trajectories into compact spatio-temporal scene graphs in a single forward pass. The temporal-window resampler binds visual tokens to short trajectory segments to preserve local motion and temporal semantics, while the object-trajectory resampler aggregates entire trajectories to maintain global context for objects. On the PVSG, VIPSeg, VidOR and SVG2 test datasets, TRaSER improves relation detection by +15 to 20%, object prediction by +30 to 40% over the strongest open-source baselines and by +13% over GPT-5, and attribute prediction by +15%.

As such, a model of the environment obtained under one set of conditions may no longer remain valid as the distribution of states or the environment dynamics change, which in turn causes previously learned strategies to fail. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for planning under partial observability using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) formulated using causal knowledge. By representing shifts in the environment as interventions on this causal POMDP, the framework enables evaluating plans under hypothesized changes and actively identifying which components of the environment have been altered. We show how to maintain and update a belief over both the latent state and the underlying domain, and we prove that the value function remains piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) in this augmented belief space. Preservation of PWLC under distribution shifts has the advantage of maintaining the tractability of planning via $α$-vector-based POMDP methods."}

We first present new behavioral evidence from humans and large language models demonstrating the robustness of this apparent non-redundancy across contexts. We then show that, in language models, redundancy avoidance arises from two interacting mechanisms: models learn to bind contextually relevant information to repeated lexical items, and Transformer induction heads selectively attend to these context-licensed representations.

Autonomous driving challenges remain a prominent area of research, requiring further exploration to enhance the perception and planning performance of vehicles. However, existing datasets are often incomplete. For instance, datasets that include perception information generally lack planning data, while planning datasets typically consist of extensive driving sequences where the ego vehicle predominantly drives forward, offering limited behavioral diversity. In addition, many real datasets struggle to evaluate their models, especially for planning tasks, since they lack a proper closed-loop evaluation setup. The CARLA Leaderboard 2.0 challenge, which provides a diverse set of scenarios to address the long-tail problem in autonomous driving, has emerged as a valuable alternative platform for developing perception and planning models in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluation setups. Nevertheless, existing datasets collected on this platform present certain limitations. Some datasets appear to be tailored primarily for limited sensor configuration, with particular sensor configurations. To support end-to-end autonomous driving research, we have collected a new dataset comprising over 2.85 million frames using the CARLA simulation environment for the diverse Leaderboard 2.0 challenge scenarios. Our dataset is designed not only for planning tasks but also supports dynamic object detection, lane divider detection, centerline detection, traffic light recognition, prediction tasks and visual language action models .

However, existing methods incur prohibitive latency overheads, up to 90x slower than base VLM prompting, rendering them impractical for latency-sensitive edge deployments. We present LE-NeuS, a latency-efficient neuro-symbolic framework that preserves the accuracy benefits of temporal logic-guided video understanding while drastically reducing inference latency. Our key insight is that the dominant computational bottleneck arises from sequential and dense proposition detection across video frames during automaton construction. We address this through two principled optimizations: (1) CLIP guided two-stage adaptive sampling that exploits visual redundancy to skip semantically similar frames while preserving temporal boundaries, and (2) batched proposition detection that parallelizes VLM inference across temporal windows. Theoretically, we derive latency bounds as a function of video length, proposition complexity, and sampling density, establishing conditions under which latency efficiency is achievable. Empirically, on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks deployed on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, LE-NeuS reduces the latency gap from 90x to approximately 10x while maintaining >10% accuracy gains on temporally complex queries."}

However, most existing methods rely on fixed search strategies with predefined knobs (e.g., explore-exploit ratios) that remain static throughout execution. While effective in some settings, these approaches often fail to adapt across tasks, or even within the same task as the search space changes over time. We introduce EvoX, an adaptive evolution method that optimizes its own evolution process. EvoX jointly evolves candidate solutions and the search strategies used to generate them, continuously updating how prior solutions are selected and varied based on progress. This enables the system to dynamically shift between different search strategies during the optimization process.

The q-values are updated by reinforcing city-pair co-occurrences in high-quality solutions, while the pool is adapted through ageing and pruning. This combination of exact optimization and reinforcement-guided construction balances exploration and exploitation.

While social media platforms offer opportunities for early risk detection through online conversation trees, existing approaches face two major limitations: (1) They rely on predefined rules (e.g., quotes or relies) to log conversations that capture only a narrow spectrum of user interactions, and (2) They overlook hidden influences such as user conformity and suicide copycat behavior, which can significantly affect suicidal expression and propagation in online communities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent Causal Reasoning (MACR) framework that collaboratively employs a Reasoning Agent to scale user interactions and a Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent to mitigate harmful biases arising from hidden influences. The Reasoning Agent integrates cognitive appraisal theory to generate counterfactual user reactions to posts, thereby scaling user interactions. It analyses these reactions through structured dimensions, i.e., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns, with a dedicated sub-agent responsible for each dimension. The Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent mitigates hidden biases through a front-door adjustment strategy, leveraging the counterfactual user reactions produced by the Reasoning Agent. Through the collaboration of reasoning and bias-aware decision making, the proposed MACR framework not only alleviates hidden biases, but also enriches contextual information of user interactions with counterfactual knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world conversational datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MACR in identifying suicide risk."}

The surrogate is justified via the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the translating/rotating load frame: when effective forcing is gravity-dominated (i.e., translational/rotational accelerations and especially jerk are limited), the fluid approaches hydrostatic equilibrium and the free surface is well approximated by a plane orthogonal to the body-frame gravity direction."}

We argue that these limitations reflect structural properties of the supervision channel rather than model scale or optimization. We develop a unified theory showing that whenever the human supervision channel is not sufficient for a latent evaluation target, it acts as an information-reducing channel that induces a strictly positive excess-risk floor for any learner dominated by it. We formalize this Human-Bounded Intelligence limit and show that across six complementary frameworks (operator theory, PAC-Bayes, information theory, causal inference, category theory, and game-theoretic analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback), non-sufficiency yields strictly positive lower bounds arising from the same structural decomposition into annotation noise, preference distortion, and semantic compression. The theory explains why scaling alone cannot eliminate persistent human-aligned errors and characterizes conditions under which auxiliary non-human signals (e.g., retrieval, program execution, tools) increase effective supervision capacity and collapse the floor by restoring information about the latent target. Experiments on real preference data, synthetic known-target tasks, and externally verifiable benchmarks confirm the predicted structural signatures: human-only supervision exhibits a persistent floor, while sufficiently informative auxiliary channels strictly reduce or eliminate excess error."}

However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by \"pasting\" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments."}

We adopt the same strategy for questionnaire data by decoupling preprocessing from prediction: we restrict nonlinear capacity to a baseline preprocessing module that estimates stable item values, and then learn a linear mapping from these stabilized baseline items to future severity. We refer to this two-stage method as REFINE (Redundancy-Exploiting Follow-up-Informed Nonlinear Enhancement), which concentrates nonlinearity in preprocessing while keeping the prognostic relationship transparently linear and therefore globally interpretable through a coefficient matrix, rather than through post hoc local attributions.

Inspired by cycle consistency, widely used in image distribution modeling, we devise an inverse view transformation (IVT) network that maps BEV segmentation maps back to PV segmentation maps and use it to regularize VT networks during training through cycle consistency losses, enabling them to capture richer semantic and geometric information from input PV images. To further exploit the capacity of the IVT network, we introduce two novel ideas that extend cycle consistency into geometric and representation spaces. We evaluate CycleBEV on four representative VT models covering three major paradigms using the large-scale nuScenes dataset.

However, the annotation of human-understandable concepts requires extensive expert knowledge and labor, constraining the broad adoption of CBMs. On the other hand, there are a few works that leverage the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to construct concept bottlenecks. Nevertheless, they face two essential limitations: First, they overlook the uncertainty associated with the concepts annotated by LLMs and lack a valid mechanism to quantify uncertainty about the annotated concepts, increasing the risk of errors due to hallucinations from LLMs. Additionally, they fail to incorporate the uncertainty associated with these annotations into the learning process for concept bottleneck models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware CBM method, which not only rigorously quantifies the uncertainty of LLM-annotated concept labels with valid and distribution-free guarantees, but also incorporates quantified concept uncertainty into the CBM training procedure to account for varying levels of reliability across LLM-annotated concepts. We also provide the theoretical analysis for our proposed method. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets validate the desired properties of our proposed methods."}

In this paper, we address what's wrong with our conception of AGI, and why, even in its most coherent formulation, it is a flawed concept to describe the future of AI. We explore whether the most widely accepted definitions are plausible, useful, and truly general. We argue that AI must embrace specialization, rather than strive for generality, and in its specialization strive for superhuman performance, and introduce Superhuman Adaptable Intelligence (SAI). SAI is defined as intelligence that can learn to exceed humans at anything important that we can do, and that can fill in the skill gaps where humans are incapable. We then lay out how SAI can help hone a discussion around AI that was blurred by an overloaded definition of AGI, and extrapolate the implications of using it as a guide for the future."}

However, existing benchmarks do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning in practical contexts. Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for assessing and advancing the realistic logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that our synthetic data-based reasoning tasks introduce non-trivial reasoning challenges and provide meaningful support for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

This paper bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online adaptation. We introduce refineCBF for refining an approximate CBF - whether analytically derived, learned, or even unsafe - via warm-started HJ reachability.

Such approaches depend on large-scale parameter updates, are resource intensive, and can perturb pretrained representations. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that independently trained foundation models may already exhibit latent semantic compatibility, reflecting shared structures in the data they model. This raises a fundamental question: can cross-modal alignment be achieved without modifying the models themselves? Here we introduce HDFLIM (HyperDimensional computing with Frozen Language and Image Models), a framework that establishes cross-modal mappings while keeping pretrained vision and language models fully frozen. HDFLIM projects unimodal embeddings into a shared hyperdimensional space and leverages lightweight symbolic operations -- binding, bundling, and similarity-based retrieval to construct associative cross-modal representations in a single pass over the data. Caption generation emerges from high-dimensional memory retrieval rather than iterative gradient-based optimization. We show that HDFLIM achieves performance comparable to end-to-end vision-language training methods and produces captions that are more semantically grounded than zero-shot baselines. By decoupling alignment from parameter tuning, our results suggest that semantic mapping across foundation models can be realized through symbolic operations on hyperdimensional encodings of the respective embeddings. More broadly, this work points toward an alternative paradigm for foundation model alignment in which frozen models are integrated through structured representational mappings rather than through large-scale retraining.

Prior clustered FL approaches also restrict knowledge and representation sharing to clients within the same cluster. This prevents cluster models from benefiting from the diverse client population across clusters. To address these limitations, FedDAG introduces a clustered FL framework, FedDAG, that employs a weighted, class-wise similarity metric that integrates both data and gradient information, providing a more holistic measure of similarity during clustering. In addition, FedDAG adopts a dual-encoder architecture for cluster models, comprising a primary encoder trained on its own clients' data and a secondary encoder refined using gradients from complementary clusters. This enables cross-cluster feature transfer while preserving cluster-specific specialization. Experiments on diverse benchmarks and data heterogeneity settings show that FedDAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustered FL baselines in accuracy."}

To address these limitations, this paper introduces PseudoAct, a novel framework for flexible planning and action control in LLM agents through pseudocode synthesis. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to express task-solving strategies as code, PseudoAct synthesizes a structured pseudocode plan that decomposes a task into subtasks and explicitly encodes control flow, including sequencing, conditionals, loops, parallel composition, and combinations of these logic primitives. Actions are then executed by following this global plan, making the decision logic explicit and temporally coherent. This design reduces redundant actions, prevents infinite loops, and avoids uninformative alternative exploration, enabling consistent and efficient long-horizon decision-making.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification.

These samples highlight structural differences in diagrammatic imagery without requiring any modification or editing of the original data. By incorporating these pseudo contrastive samples into the training objective, the model learns to capture more precise and semantically consistent diagram structures.\n  Empirical evaluations on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts demonstrate substantial improvements over standard CLIP and hard-negative CLIP training in both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. The results underscore the value of domain-specific training strategies and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader context of vision-language learning."}

Inadequate sample sizes can lead to overfitting, poor generalisability, and biased predictions. Existing approaches, such as heuristic rules, closed-form formulas, and simulation-based methods, vary in flexibility and accuracy, particularly for complex data structures and machine learning models. Methods: We review current methodologies for sample size estimation in prediction modelling and introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes between mean-based and assurance-based criteria. Building on this, we propose a novel simulation-based approach that integrates learning curves, Gaussian Process optimisation, and assurance principles to identify sample sizes that achieve target performance with high probability. This approach is implemented in pmsims, an open-source, model-agnostic R package. Results: Through case studies, we demonstrate that sample size estimates vary substantially across methods, performance metrics, and modelling strategies. Compared to existing tools, pmsims provides flexible, efficient, and interpretable solutions that accommodate diverse models and user-defined metrics while explicitly accounting for variability in model performance. Conclusions: Our framework and software advance sample size methodology for clinical prediction modelling by combining flexibility with computational efficiency. Future work should extend these methods to hierarchical and multimodal data, incorporate fairness and stability metrics, and address challenges such as missing data and complex dependency structures."}

We propose ODAR-Expert, an adaptive routing framework that optimizes the accuracy-efficiency trade-off via principled resource allocation. ODAR uses a difficulty estimator grounded in amortized active inference to dynamically route queries between a heuristic Fast Agent and a deliberative Slow Agent. We further introduce a free-energy-principled, risk-sensitive fusion mechanism that selects answers by minimizing a variational free energy objective, balancing log-likelihood with epistemic uncertainty (varentropy) as a principled alternative to ad hoc voting over heterogeneous candidates. Extensive evaluation across 23 benchmarks shows strong and consistent gains, including 98.2% accuracy on MATH and 54.8% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), while improving the compute-accuracy frontier under compute-matched settings. We also validate reproducibility on a fully open-source stack (Llama 4 + DeepSeek), where ODAR surpasses homogeneous sampling strategies while reducing computational costs by 82%.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks."}

While effective for short tasks, these approaches often lead to redundant tool usage, unstable reasoning, and high token consumption in complex long-horizon tasks involving branching, iteration, or multi-tool coordination. To address these limitations, this paper introduces PseudoAct, a novel framework for flexible planning and action control in LLM agents through pseudocode synthesis. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to express task-solving strategies as code, PseudoAct synthesizes a structured pseudocode plan that decomposes a task into subtasks and explicitly encodes control flow, including sequencing, conditionals, loops, parallel composition, and combinations of these logic primitives. Actions are then executed by following this global plan, making the decision logic explicit and temporally coherent. This design reduces redundant actions, prevents infinite loops, and avoids uninformative alternative exploration, enabling consistent and efficient long-horizon decision-making. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing reactive agent approaches, achieving a 20.93% absolute gain in success rate on FEVER and setting a new state-of-the-art on HotpotQA."}

This design ignores the mismatched sampling rates of real robot sensors, forcing downsampling of the high-frequency contact cues needed for reactive correction. Combined with common VLM-action-expert (AE) pipelines that execute action chunks largely open loop between expensive VLM updates, unified-frequency fusion often yields delayed responses to impacts, stick-slip, and force spikes. We propose FAVLA, a force-adaptive fast-slow VLA that decouples slow perception planning from fast contact-aware control. FAVLA runs a slow VLM at a fixed low frequency to encode modalities to produce latent representations and to predict near-future force variation. A fast AE then executes at a variable high frequency, conditioning on the latest force sequence data to generate reactive actions. We further introduce a force adapter that injects high-frequency force features into multiple AE layers, and adaptively schedules the AE's execution frequency based on the VLM's predicted force variation. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that FAVLA significantly outperforms baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates, especially with a smaller contact force during manipulation."}

While our algorithm essentially computes truncated singular value decomposition of these features, other than processing all vectors at once, our algorithm groups the vectors into batches. At each batch, our algorithm updates the truncated singular values and vectors that represent all visited vectors, and reduces each batch by its own singular values and vectors so they can be stored in the memory with low overhead. After processing all batches, we re-transform these batch-wise singular vectors to the space spanned by the singular vectors of all features. We show that our algorithm can accelerate the training of state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm with close accuracy."}

Our universal clustering theorem shows that any $K$ closed classes can be approximated to arbitrary precision by NO-parameterized classes in the upper Kuratowski topology on closed sets, a notion that can be interpreted as disallowing false-positive misclassifications.\n  Building on this, we develop an NO-powered clustering pipeline for functional data and apply it to unlabeled families of ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectories.

The framework first uses a pretrained language model to encode the input text and obtain basic semantic representations. It then introduces structured prompts composed of multi-dimensional semantic factors and integrates them with text features through a learnable combination mechanism, which forms task-related representations with clear boundaries in the latent space. To further strengthen the consistency between text representations and label semantics, the method constructs a structured label embedding matrix and employs a cross-space alignment mechanism to ensure stable matching between textual features and label attributes. In addition, the model applies prompt orthogonality constraints and a joint optimization objective to maintain independence across different semantic factors in the prompts, allowing the structured prompts to provide transparent and controllable guidance for classification decisions. Three types of sensitivity experiments, including learning rate sensitivity, prompt length sensitivity, and data scale sensitivity, are designed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the framework under different conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed structured prompt optimization framework effectively alleviates semantic conflicts and label ambiguity in few-shot text classification. It significantly improves performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, and demonstrates strong cross-task applicability."}

However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation.

In this context, hands-free teleoperation enhances operator mobility and situational awareness, thereby improving safety in hazardous environments. While vision-based gesture recognition has been explored as one method for hands-free teleoperation, its performance often deteriorates under occlusions, lighting variations, and cluttered backgrounds, limiting its applicability in real-world operations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multimodal gesture recognition framework that integrates inertial data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation) from Apple Watches on both wrists with capacitive sensing signals from custom gloves. We design a late fusion strategy based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), which not only enhances recognition performance but also provides interpretability by quantifying modality-specific contributions. To support this research, we introduce a new dataset of 20 distinct gestures inspired by aircraft marshalling signals, comprising synchronized RGB video, IMU, and capacitive sensor data. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to a state-of-the-art vision-based baseline while significantly reducing computational cost, model size, and training time, making it well suited for real-time robot control. We therefore underscore the potential of sensor-based multimodal fusion as a robust and interpretable solution for gesture-driven mobile robot and drone teleoperation."}

However, while these models demonstrate plausible adherence to instructions and strong reasoning ability on current benchmarks, their ability to edit small objects remains underexplored, despite its importance for precise local editing and refining details in both real and generated images. In this paper, we introduce DeepLookEditBench (DLEBench), the first benchmark dedicated to assessing the abilities of IIEMs in editing small-scale objects. Specifically, we construct a challenging testbed comprising 1889 samples across seven instruction types. In these samples, target objects occupy only 1%-10% of the image area, covering complex scenarios such as partial occlusion and multi-object editing. To ensure robust evaluation on this benchmark, we propose an evaluation protocol with refined score rubrics to minimize subjectivity and ambiguity in two criteria: Instruction Following and Visual Consistency. This protocol also introduces a dual-mode evaluation framework (Tool-driven and Oracle-guided Modes) addressing the misalignment between LMM-as-a-Judge and human judgements on DLEBench. Empirical results on 10 IIEMs reveal significant performance gaps in small-scale object editing, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks to advance this ability."}

Prior work in this setting focuses exclusively on the \"local\" losses of learners on the distribution of data that they observe. We find that there exist instances where learners who use existing algorithms almost surely converge to models with arbitrarily poor global performance, even when models with low full-population loss exist. This happens through a feedback-induced mechanism, which we call the overspecialization trap: as learners optimize for users who already prefer them, they become less attractive to users outside this base, which further restricts the data they observe. Inspired by the recent use of knowledge distillation in modern ML, we propose an algorithm that allows learners to \"probe\" the predictions of peer models, enabling them to learn about users who do not select them. Our analysis characterizes when probing succeeds: this procedure converges almost surely to a stationary point with bounded full-population risk when probing sources are sufficiently informative, e.g., a known market leader or a majority of peers with good global performance. We verify our findings with semi-synthetic experiments on the MovieLens, Census, and Amazon Sentiment datasets."}

We present a progressive training pipeline that explicitly decouples and then integrates \"System 1\" (Perception) and \"System 2\" (Reasoning) capabilities. First, we establish a robust Perception Backbone by aligning region-specific audio-visual cues (e.g., Singlish code-switching, local cultural landmarks) with a multilingual LLM through orthogonal modality adaptation. Second, to inject cognitive capabilities without large-scale supervision, we propose a cost-effective Generate-Judge-Refine pipeline. By utilizing a Super-LLM to filter hallucinations and resolve conflicts via a consensus mechanism, we synthesize high-quality silver data that transfers textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning to multimodal scenarios.\n  Comprehensive evaluation on our newly introduced SEA-Omni Benchmark Suite reveals an Efficiency-Stability Paradox: while reasoning acts as a non-linear amplifier for abstract tasks (boosting mathematical and instruction-following performance significantly), it introduces instability in low-level sensory processing. Specifically, we identify Temporal Drift in long-context audio, where extended reasoning desynchronizes the model from acoustic timestamps, and Visual Over-interpretation, where logic overrides pixel-level reality.

We construct a mixed, multi-domain Chinese professional writing dataset spanning current affairs, finance, law, and medicine. We then conduct a systematic study of LLM-based correction paradigms, from prompting to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. The analysis reveals practical challenges, including limited generalization of specialized correction models, the need for evidence grounding for factual repair, the difficulty of mixed-error paragraphs, and over-correction on clean inputs.

Users must depend on confusing, time-consuming static signage or floor maps. In this paper, an AR-based technique has been applied to campus and small-site navigation, where Vuforia Area Target is used for environment modeling. AI navigation's NavMesh component is used for navigation purposes, and the A* algorithm is used within this component for shortest path calculation. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, it can reach a solution about two to three times faster for smaller search spaces. In many cases, Dijkstra's algorithm has difficulty performing well in high-complexity environments where memory usage grows and processing times increase. Compared to older approaches such as GPS, real-time processing and AR overlays can be combined to provide intuitive directions for users while dynamically updating the path in response to environmental changes. Experimental results indicate significantly improved navigation accuracy, better user experience, and greater efficiency compared to traditional methods. These results show that AR technology integrated with existing pathfinding algorithms is feasible and scalable, making it a user-friendly solution for indoor navigation.

Specifically, we design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes. We first formulate distribution recovery as a conditional generation task by training latent diffusion models conditioned on input point clouds, and then tailor a decoder-only transformer for conditional autoregressive mesh generation based on the recovered point clouds. Our method delivers substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements over prior building abstraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by the strong performance of its recovered point clouds on building point cloud completion benchmarks, which exhibit improved surface accuracy and distribution uniformity."}

While most DG methods focus on enforcing visual feature invariance, we leverage the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explore the potential of constructing reasoning chains that derives image categories to achieve more robust predictions under domain shift. To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling. Experiments on standard DomainBed datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc) demonstrate that RD-MLDG achieves state-of-the-art performances, highlighting reasoning as a promising complementary signal for robust out-of-domain generalization."}

Such representations may limit spatial reasoning and long-horizon decision-making in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we propose StemVLA, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates both future-oriented 3D spatial knowledge and historical 4D spatiotemporal representations into action prediction. First, instead of relying solely on observed images, StemVLA forecasts structured 3D future spatial-geometric world knowledge, enabling the model to anticipate upcoming scene geometry and object configurations. Second, to capture temporal consistency and motion dynamics, we feed historical image frames into a pretrained video-geometry transformer backbone to extract implicit 3D world representations, and further aggregate them across time using a temporal attention module, termed VideoFormer [20], forming a unified 4D historical spatiotemporal representation. By jointly modeling 2D observations, predicted 3D future structure, and aggregated 4D temporal dynamics, StemVLA enables more comprehensive world understanding for robot manipulation. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that StemVLA significantly improves long-horizon task success and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmark [46], achieving an average sequence length of XXX."}

While Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate this, existing VLM-based TTA methods operate under a closed-set assumption, failing in open-set scenarios where test streams contain both covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) and out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. This leads to a critical difficulty: the model must discriminate unknown csOOD samples to avoid interference while simultaneously adapting to known csID classes for accuracy. Current open-set TTA (OSTTA) methods rely on hard thresholds for separation and entropy minimization for adaptation. These strategies are brittle, often misclassifying ambiguous csOOD samples and inducing overconfident predictions, and their parameter-update mechanism is computationally prohibitive for VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Double-Check Separation (ProtoDCS), a robust framework for OSTTA that effectively separates csID and csOOD samples, enabling safe and efficient adaptation of VLMs to csID data. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel double-check separation mechanism employing probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) verification to replace brittle thresholding; and (2) an evidence-driven adaptation strategy utilizing uncertainty-aware loss and efficient prototype-level updates, mitigating overconfidence and reducing computational overhead.

The pipeline presented here combines a classifier to identify coordinate-bearing entries and a second model for retrieval, tested across encoder-decoder and decoder architectures. Cross-validation yielded an 86% EM score. On an out-of-domain eighteenth-century Trevoux dictionary (also in French), our fine-tuned model had a 61% EM score, while for the nineteenth-century, 7th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in English, the EM was 77%. These findings highlight the gold standard dataset's usefulness as training data, and our two-step method's cross-lingual, cross-domain generalizability."}

This paper presents an acceleration-level outer-loop control framework that converts commanded tangential and normal accelerations into executable body-rate and normalized thrust commands compatible with mainstream autopilots (e.g., PX4/APM). For the normal channel, we derive an engineering mapping from the desired normal acceleration to roll- and pitch-rate commands that regulate the direction and magnitude of the lift vector under small-angle assumptions. For the tangential channel, we introduce an energy-based formulation inspired by total energy control and identify an empirical thrust-energy acceleration relationship directly from flight data, avoiding explicit propulsion modeling or thrust bench calibration. We further discuss priority handling between normal and tangential accelerations under saturation and non-level maneuvers. Extensive real-flight experiments on a VTOL fixed-wing platform demonstrate accurate acceleration tracking and enable practical implementation of proportional navigation using only body-rate and normalized thrust interfaces."}

We address this challenge with a training-free, inference-time control framework termed Semantically Decoupled Latent Steering (SDLS). Unlike generic activation steering, which often suffers from semantic entanglement, our approach constructs a semantic-free intervention vector via large language model (LLM)-driven semantic decomposition followed by $QR$-based orthogonalization. This orthogonalization step is critical. It leverages geometric constraints to filter out the clinical semantics often entangled in standard principal component analysis (PCA) directions, ensuring that the steering vector targets only the ``historical comparison\" axis. We validate our method on the BiomedGPT foundation model, demonstrating that it overcomes the trade-off between hallucination suppression and clinical accuracy. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, and zero-shot transfer evaluation on CheXpert Plus and IU-Xray, demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Quantitative evaluations on MIMIC-CXR show that our approach significantly reduces the probability of historical hallucinations (FilBERT score decreases from 0.2373 to 0.1889) and improves clinical label fidelity (CheXpert macro-F1 increases from 0.2242 to 0.3208).

We present a systematic ablation of initialisation and normalisation strategies across three GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset.

However, discrepancies in morphology and dynamics between humans and robots, combined with data noise, introduce physically infeasible artifacts in reference motions, such as floating and penetration. During both training and execution, these artifacts create a conflict between following inaccurate reference motions and maintaining the robot's stability, hindering the development of a generalizable motion tracking policy. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniTrack, a general tracking framework that explicitly decouples physical feasibility from general motion tracking. In the first stage, a privileged generalist policy generates physically plausible motions that strictly adhere to the robot's dynamics via trajectory rollout in simulation. In the second stage, the general control policy is trained to track these physically feasible motions, ensuring stable and coherent control transfer to the real robot. Experiments show that OmniTrack improves tracking accuracy and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen motions. In real-world tests, OmniTrack achieves hour-long, consistent, and stable tracking, including complex acrobatic motions such as flips and cartwheels. Additionally, we show that OmniTrack supports human-style stable and dynamic online teleoperation, highlighting its robustness and adaptability to varying user inputs."}

However, existing deep learning models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous agricultural environments due to reliance on dataset-specific visual features. We propose Vision-Language Weed Segmentation (VL-WS), a novel framework that addresses this limitation by grounding pixel-level segmentation in semantically aligned, domain-invariant representations. Our architecture employs a dual-encoder design, where frozen Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings and task-specific spatial features are fused and modulated via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers conditioned on natural language captions. This design enables image level textual descriptions to guide channel-wise feature refinement while preserving fine-grained spatial localization. Unlike prior works restricted to training and evaluation on single-source datasets, VL-WS is trained on a unified corpus that includes close-range ground imagery (robotic platforms) and high-altitude UAV imagery, covering diverse crop types, weed species, growth stages, and sensing conditions. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, with VL-WS achieving a mean Dice score of 91.64% and outperforming the CNN baseline by 4.98%. The largest gains occur on the most challenging weed class, where VL-WS attains 80.45% Dice score compared to 65.03% for the best baseline, representing a 15.42% improvement. VL-WS further maintains stable weed segmentation performance under limited target-domain supervision, indicating improved generalization and data efficiency.

A Benchmark on EHR and Chest X-Ray Fusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning holds promise for advancing clinical decision support, yet it remains unclear when multimodal learning truly helps in practice, particularly under modality missingness and fairness constraints. In this work, we conduct a systematic benchmark of multimodal fusion between Electronic Health Records (EHR) and chest X-rays (CXR) on standardized cohorts from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR, aiming to answer four fundamental questions: when multimodal fusion improves clinical prediction, how different fusion strategies compare, how robust existing methods are to missing modalities, and whether multimodal models achieve algorithmic fairness. Our study reveals several key insights. Multimodal fusion improves performance when modalities are complete, with gains concentrating in diseases that require complementary information from both EHR and CXR. While cross-modal learning mechanisms capture clinically meaningful dependencies beyond simple concatenation, the rich temporal structure of EHR introduces strong modality imbalance that architectural complexity alone cannot overcome. Under realistic missingness, multimodal benefits rapidly degrade unless models are explicitly designed to handle incomplete inputs. Moreover, multimodal fusion does not inherently improve fairness, with subgroup disparities mainly arising from unequal sensitivity across demographic groups. To support reproducible and extensible evaluation, we further release a flexible benchmarking toolkit that enables plug-and-play integration of new models and datasets. Together, this work provides actionable guidance on when multimodal learning helps, when it fails, and why, laying the foundation for developing clinically deployable multimodal systems that are both effective and reliable.

However, inevitable access to out-ofdistribution actions during the learning process introduces approximation errors, causing the error accumulation and considerable overestimation. In this paper, we construct a new pessimistic auxiliary policy for sampling reliable actions. Specifically, we develop a pessimistic auxiliary strategy by maximizing the lower confidence bound of the Q-function. The pessimistic auxiliary strategy exhibits a relatively high value and low uncertainty in the vicinity of the learned policy, avoiding the learned policy sampling high-value actions with potentially high errors during the learning process. Less approximation error introduced by sampled action from pessimistic auxiliary strategy leads to the alleviation of error accumulation. Extensive experiments on offline reinforcement learning benchmarks reveal that utilizing the pessimistic auxiliary strategy can effectively improve the efficacy of other offline RL approaches."}

To overcome these challenges, we introduce OmniXtreme, a scalable framework that decouples general motor skill learning from sim-to-real physical skill refinement. Our approach uses a flow-matching policy with high-capacity architectures to scale representation capacity without interference-intensive multi-motion RL optimization, followed by an actuation-aware refinement phase that ensures robust performance on physical hardware.

Most of the existing automated HPO methods are accuracy-based, i.e., accuracy metrics are used to guide the trials of different hyperparameter configurations amongst a specific search space. However, many trials may encounter severe training problems, such as vanishing gradients and insufficient convergence, which can hardly be reflected by accuracy metrics in the early stages of the training and often result in poor performance. This leads to an inefficient optimization trajectory because the bad trials occupy considerable computation resources and reduce the probability of finding excellent hyperparameter configurations within a time limitation. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Bad Trial Tackler (BTTackler)}, a novel HPO framework that introduces training diagnosis to identify training problems automatically and hence tackles bad trials. BTTackler diagnoses each trial by calculating a set of carefully designed quantified indicators and triggers early termination if any training problems are detected. Evaluations are performed on representative HPO tasks consisting of three classical deep neural networks (DNN) and four widely used HPO methods. To better quantify the effectiveness of an automated HPO method, we propose two new measurements based on accuracy and time consumption.

Existing solutions typically rely on distal force sensing or analytical compensation, increasing hardware complexity or degrading performance under dynamic motion. We present a sensorless control framework that combines physics-consistent modeling and hybrid reinforcement learning to achieve high-precision distal force regulation in a proximally actuated surgical end-effector. We develop a first-principles digital twin of the da Vinci Xi grasping mechanism that captures coupled electrical, transmission, and jaw dynamics within a unified differential-algebraic formulation. To safely learn control policies in this stiff and highly nonlinear system, we introduce a three-stage pipeline:(i)a receding-horizon CMA-ES oracle that generates dynamically feasible expert trajectories,(ii)fully offline policy learning via Implicit Q-Learning to ensure stable initialization without unsafe exploration, and (iii)online refinement using TD3 for adaptation to on-policy dynamics. The resulting policy directly maps proximal measurements to motor voltages and requires no distal sensing. In simulation, the controller maintains grasp force within 1% of the desired reference during multi-harmonic jaw motion. Hardware experiments demonstrate average force errors below 4% across diverse trajectories, validating sim-to-real transfer. The learned policy contains approximately 71k param and executes at kH rates, enabling real-time deployment. These results demonstrate that high-fidelity modeling combined with structured offline-online RL can recover precise distal force behavior without additional sensing, offering a scalable and mechanically compatible solution for surgical robotic manipulation."}

In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a refined convergence analysis of the Single-loop Stochastic Approximate Implicit Differentiation (SSAID) algorithm. We prove that SSAID achieves an $ε$-stationary point with an oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(κ^7 ε^{-2})$. Our result is noteworthy in two aspects: (i) it matches the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ rate of state-of-the-art multi-loop methods (e.g., stocBiO) while maintaining the computational efficiency of a single-loop update; and (ii) it provides the first explicit, fine-grained characterization of the $κ$-dependence for stochastic AID-based single-loop methods.

With only local and incomplete cues, interaction patterns can change rapidly, often causing unstable behaviors such as oscillatory yielding or unsafe commitments. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches either adopt synchronous decision-making, which exacerbate non-stationarity, or depend on centralized sequencing mechanisms that scale poorly as traffic density increases. To address these limitations, we propose Topology-conditioned Stackelberg Coordination (TSC), a learning framework for decentralized interactive driving under communication-free execution, which extracts a time-varying directed priority graph from braid-inspired weaving relations between trajectories, thereby defining local leader-follower dependencies without constructing a global order of play. Conditioned on this graph, TSC endogenously factorizes dense interactions into graph-local Stackelberg subgames and, under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), learns a sequential coordination policy that anticipates leaders via action prediction and trains followers through action-conditioned value learning to approximate local best responses, improving training stability and safety in dense traffic. Experiments across four dense traffic scenarios show that TSC achieves superior performance over representative MARL baselines across key metrics, most notably reducing collisions while maintaining competitive traffic efficiency and control smoothness."}

While progressive vision token pruning offers a promising solution, current methods misinterpret shallow layer functions and use rigid schedules, which fail to unlock the full efficiency potential. To address these issues, we propose HiDrop, a framework that aligns token pruning with the true hierarchical function of MLLM layers. HiDrop features two key innovations: (1) Late Injection, which bypasses passive shallow layers to introduce visual tokens exactly where active fusion begins; and (2) Concave Pyramid Pruning with an Early Exit mechanism to dynamically adjust pruning rates across middle and deep layers. This process is optimized via an inter-layer similarity measure and a differentiable top-k operator. To ensure practical efficiency, HiDrop further incorporates persistent positional encoding, FlashAttention-compatible token selection, and parallel decoupling of vision computation to eliminate hidden overhead associated with dynamic token reduction. Extensive experiments show that HiDrop compresses about 90% visual tokens while matching the original performance and accelerating training by 1.72 times. Our work not only sets a new state-of-the-art for efficient MLLM training and inference but also provides valuable insights into the hierarchical nature of multimodal fusion.

Most existing guardrail models formulate moderation as a fixed binary classification task, implicitly assuming a fixed definition of harmfulness. In practice, enforcement strictness - how conservatively harmfulness is defined and enforced - varies across platforms and evolves over time, making binary moderators brittle under shifting requirements. We first introduce FlexBench, a strictness-adaptive LLM moderation benchmark that enables controlled evaluation under multiple strictness regimes. Experiments on FlexBench reveal substantial cross-strictness inconsistency in existing moderators: models that perform well under one regime can degrade substantially under others, limiting their practical usability. To address this, we propose FlexGuard, an LLM-based moderator that outputs a calibrated continuous risk score reflecting risk severity and supports strictness-specific decisions via thresholding. We train FlexGuard via risk-alignment optimization to improve score-severity consistency and provide practical threshold selection strategies to adapt to target strictness at deployment. Experiments on FlexBench and public benchmarks demonstrate that FlexGuard achieves higher moderation accuracy and substantially improved robustness under varying strictness.

For modern speech-to-speech (S2S) systems, a critical yet unanswered question is whether they can converse like humans. To tackle this, we conduct the first Turing test for S2S systems, collecting 2,968 human judgments on dialogues between 9 state-of-the-art S2S systems and 28 human participants. Our results deliver a clear finding: no existing evaluated S2S system passes the test, revealing a significant gap in human-likeness. To diagnose this failure, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy of 18 human-likeness dimensions and crowd-annotate our collected dialogues accordingly. Our analysis shows that the bottleneck is not semantic understanding but stems from paralinguistic features, emotional expressivity, and conversational persona. Furthermore, we find that off-the-shelf AI models perform unreliably as Turing test judges. In response, we propose an interpretable model that leverages the fine-grained human-likeness ratings and delivers accurate and transparent human-vs-machine discrimination, offering a powerful tool for automatic human-likeness evaluation.

Preference packing improves resource efficiency by reducing the attention operations for duplicate input prompts and decreasing KV cache memory usage.

EgoGraph employs a novel egocentric schema that unifies the extraction and abstraction of core entities, such as people, objects, locations, and events, and structurally reasons about their attributes and interactions, yielding a significantly richer and more coherent semantic representation than traditional clip-based video models.

In practice, however, a discrepancy between the factor-wise averaging used to preserve low rank and the mathematically correct aggregation of local updates can cause significant aggregation error and unstable training. We argue that a major source of this problem is rotational misalignment, arising from the rotational invariance of low-rank factorizations -- semantically equivalent updates can be represented in different latent subspaces across clients since $(B_i R_i)(R_i^\\top A_i) = B_i A_i$. When such misaligned factors are averaged directly, they interfere destructively and degrade the global update. To address this issue, we propose FedRot-LoRA, a federated LoRA framework that aligns client updates via orthogonal transformations prior to aggregation. This alignment preserves the semantic update while reducing cross-client subspace mismatch, without increasing communication cost or restricting model expressivity. We provide a convergence analysis that examines the aggregation error induced by factor-wise averaging and shows how rotational alignment yields a tighter upper bound on this error. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrate that FedRot-LoRA consistently outperforms existing federated LoRA baselines across a range of heterogeneity levels and LoRA ranks."}

At the upper level, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent strategically partitions the road network into manageable clusters and optimally allocates resources from multiple depots.

However, existing evaluations typically assess these capabilities separately, overlooking semantic equivalence, i.e., the ability to manifest consistent reasoning results regardless of the output modality. In this work, we investigate whether current U-MLLMs satisfy this premise. We observe that while models demonstrate robust textual reasoning, they fail to maintain semantic equivalence when required to render the same results in the image modality. To rigorously diagnose this discrepancy, we introduce VGUBench, a framework to decouple reasoning logic from generation fidelity. VGUBench comprises three diagnostic tasks: (1)Textual Generative Understanding, establishing a baseline for reasoning accuracy in textual response; (2)Visual Generative Understanding, evaluating the ability to generate visual responses that represent the correct answer; and (3)a Visual Rendering control task, which assesses the ability to directly render explicit visual descriptions into images without complex reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a significant disparity: despite strong performance in textual understanding and visual rendering, U-MLLMs exhibit a marked performance collapse when required to generate visual answers to questions. Furthermore, we find a negligible correlation between visual answering performance and basic rendering quality. These results suggest that the failure stems not from insufficient generation fidelity, but from a breakdown in cross-modal semantic alignment. We provide diagnostic insights to address this challenge in future Unified Generation and Understanding Models."}

Diffusion models have recently attracted attention due to their advanced generative capabilities. Existing diffusion-based methods for TSAD rely on a conditional strategy, which reconstructs input instances from white noise with the aid of the conditioner. However, this poses challenges in accurately reconstructing the normal parts, resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In response, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, named AnomalyFilter, which acts as a selective filter that only denoises anomaly parts in the instance while retaining normal parts. To build such a filter, we mask Gaussian noise during the training phase and conduct the denoising process without adding noise to the instances. The synergy of the two simple components greatly enhances the performance of naive diffusion models. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that AnomalyFilter achieves notably low reconstruction error on normal parts, providing empirical support for its effectiveness in anomaly detection. AnomalyFilter represents a pioneering approach that focuses on the noise design of diffusion models specifically tailored for TSAD."}

We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages."}

Specifically, MoST uses a tensor slicing approach to reduce the complexity of the TTS structure and learns representations that can be disentangled into individual non-temporal modes. Each representation captures mode-specific features, which are the relationship between variables within the same mode, and mode-invariant features, which are in common in representations of different modes. We employ a contrastive learning framework to learn parameters; the loss function comprises two parts intended to learn representation in a mode-specific way and mode-invariant way, effectively exploiting disentangled representations as augmentations.

However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space.

First, we construct YE-KG, the first large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal knowledge graph, with over 86k nodes and 83k edges, derived from real-world indoor videos. By leveraging multimodal large language models (i.e., LLaVa, GPT4), we extract unstructured video streams into structured semantic-action-effect events to serve as explicit episodic memory. Second, we introduce STE-VLN, which integrates the above graph into VLN models via a Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Retrieval mechanism. This allows agents to retrieve causal event sequences and dynamically fuse them with egocentric visual observations. Experiments on REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our event-centric strategy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across diverse action spaces.

While token pruning offers a path to efficiency, existing methods are fragmented. They typically prune the search region, dynamic template, and static template in isolation, overlooking critical inter-component dependencies, which yields suboptimal pruning and degraded accuracy. To address this, we introduce UTPTrack, a simple and Unified Token Pruning framework that, for the first time, jointly compresses all three components. UTPTrack employs an attention-guided, token type-aware strategy to holistically model redundancy, a design that seamlessly supports unified tracking across multimodal and language-guided tasks within a single model. Extensive evaluations on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that UTPTrack achieves a new state-of-the-art in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for pruning-based trackers, pruning 65.4% of vision tokens in RGB-based tracking and 67.5% in unified tracking while preserving 99.7% and 100.5% of baseline performance, respectively. This strong performance across both RGB and multimodal scenarios underlines its potential as a robust foundation for future research in efficient visual tracking.

Using uncentered, row-normalized trajectory PCA, we show that a single direction captures a large fraction of cumulative parameter movement early in training, while remaining components encode oscillatory behavior in auxiliary probe performance. Instantaneous gradients exhibit little alignment with this dominant direction, indicating that it arises from accumulated optimizer updates rather than per-batch gradient structure. Comparing AdamW with SGD variants at matched loss levels reveals substantial differences in trajectory geometry: AdamW develops multi-dimensional drift structure, whereas SGD-family optimizers produce nearly colinear parameter evolution and weaker probe dynamics. Reheating selectively perturbs transverse components with minimal effect on the dominant drift coordinate. These findings suggest that optimizer choice shapes the effective dimensionality and structure of learning trajectories beyond what is apparent from loss values alone."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that enables robust control policy learning for inverted pose on MBRs. The proposed framework operates through three core stages: First, a high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) simulation environment was constructed, which was calibrated against real-world MBR motion data to ensure accurate replication of inverted-state dynamics. Second, a robust policy for MBR inverted control was trained within the simulation environment via a domain randomization strategy and a modified Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Third, a mapping layer was designed to bridge the sim-to-real gap for the learned policy deployment. Comprehensive evaluations in the simulation environment demonstrate that the learned policy achieves a higher success rate compared to the energy-shaping controller. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that the learned policy with a mapping layer enables an MBR to achieve and maintain a fully upside-down pose in real-world settings."}

At its core, U-Mind implements a Unified Alignment and Reasoning Framework that addresses two key challenges: enhancing cross-modal synchronization via a segment-wise alignment strategy, and preserving reasoning abilities through Rehearsal-Driven Learning. During inference, U-Mind adopts a text-first decoding pipeline that performs internal chain-of-thought planning followed by temporally synchronized generation across modalities. To close the loop, we implement a real-time video rendering framework conditioned on pose and speech, enabling expressive and synchronized visual feedback.

To address this, we leverage a heterogeneous graph network within the DRL framework to model the global state.

Our algorithm relies on camera-LiDAR sensor fusion for online detection and localization of insulators. In particular, the algorithm is based on insulator detection using a convolutional neural network, projection of LiDAR points onto the image, and filtering them using the bounding boxes. The detection pipeline is coupled with several proposed insulator localization methods based on DBSCAN, RANSAC, and PCA algorithms. The performance of the proposed online inspection algorithm and camera-LiDAR sensor fusion pipeline is demonstrated through simulation and real-world flights. In simulation, we showed that our single-flight inspection strategy can save up to 24 % of total inspection time, compared to the two-flight strategy of scanning the tower and afterwards visiting the inspection waypoints in the optimal way. In a real-world experiment, the best performing proposed method achieves a mean horizontal and vertical localization error for the insulator of 0.16 +- 0.08 m and 0.16 +- 0.11 m, respectively.

We then introduce Iterative Patch Optimization (IPO), a feature-space refinement procedure that progressively enforces spatial coherence and semantic consistency through iterative patch clustering. The refined masks are subsequently used as supervisory signals to train a lightweight segmentation head with contrastive and region-consistency objectives, allowing the model to learn stable and transferable object representations. Despite its simplicity and complete absence of manual supervision, Selfment sets new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. It achieves substantial improvements on $F_{\\max}$ over previous unsupervised saliency detection methods on ECSSD ($+4.0\\%$), HKUIS ($+4.6\\%$), and PASCAL-S ($+5.7\\%$).

This work represents the first attempt to employ LLMs in the field of optical design. We bridge the expertise gap by enabling users without formal optical training to successfully develop functional lens systems. Concretely, we curate a comprehensive dataset, named OptiDesignQA, which encompasses both classical lens systems sourced from standard optical textbooks and novel configurations generated by automated design algorithms for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we inject domain-specific optical expertise into the LLM through a hybrid objective of full-system synthesis and lens completion.

We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design.

We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose MAGE, a Multi-scale Autoregressive GEneration-based offline RL method. MAGE incorporates a condition-guided multi-scale autoencoder to learn hierarchical trajectory representations, along with a multi-scale transformer that autoregressively generates trajectory representations from coarse to fine temporal scales. MAGE effectively captures temporal dependencies of trajectories at multiple resolutions. Additionally, a condition-guided decoder is employed to exert precise control over short-term behaviors.

We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks.

Particularly, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results of 78.72% mAP on DOTA-v1.0 and 72.28% mAP on DOTA-v1.5 datasets with single scale training and testing, validating the efficacy of our approach in remote sensing object detection.

Preprint", "summary": "Foundation models have transformed domains from language to genomics by learning general-purpose representations from large-scale, heterogeneous data. We introduce TradeFM, a 524M-parameter generative Transformer that brings this paradigm to market microstructure, learning directly from billions of trade events across >9K equities. To enable cross-asset generalization, we develop scale-invariant features and a universal tokenization scheme that map the heterogeneous, multi-modal event stream of order flow into a unified discrete sequence -- eliminating asset-specific calibration. Integrated with a deterministic market simulator, TradeFM-generated rollouts reproduce key stylized facts of financial returns, including heavy tails, volatility clustering, and absence of return autocorrelation. Quantitatively, TradeFM achieves 2-3x lower distributional error than Compound Hawkes baselines and generalizes zero-shot to geographically out-of-distribution APAC markets with moderate perplexity degradation. Together, these results suggest that scale-invariant trade representations capture transferable structure in market microstructure, opening a path toward synthetic data generation, stress testing, and learning-based trading agents."}

There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data."}

In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption."}

Sea$^2$ keeps all perception modules frozen, requiring no downstream labels during training, and uses only scalar perceptual feedback to navigate the agent toward informative viewpoints. Specially, we transform a vision-language model (VLM) into a low-level pose controller through a two-stage training pipeline: first fine-tuning it on rule-based exploration trajectories that systematically probe indoor scenes, and then refining the policy via unsupervised reinforcement learning that constructs rewards from the perception module's outputs and confidence. Unlike prior active perception methods that couple exploration with specific models or collect data for retraining them, Sea$^2$ directly leverages off-the-shelf perception models for various tasks without the need for retraining.

For $N \\geq 3$ views, the objective provably isolates the jointly correlated subspaces shared across all views while eliminating view-private variations.

To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

Across these stress tests and data scaling, we find that for representative VLA policies, including SmolVLA and $π_{0.5}$, execution of the manipulation primitive remains substantially more reliable than instruction-conditioned task success in harder regimes, suggesting that manipulation skill acquisition is decoupled from instruction following.

However, existing methods typically rely on 2D features with limited spatial awareness, or require explicit point clouds that are difficult to obtain reliably in real-world settings. At the same time, recent 3D geometric foundation models show that accurate and diverse 3D structure can be reconstructed directly from RGB images in a fast and robust manner. We leverage this opportunity and propose a framework that builds bimanual manipulation directly on a pre-trained 3D geometric foundation model. Our policy fuses geometry-aware latents, 2D semantic features, and proprioception into a unified state representation, and uses diffusion model to jointly predict a future action chunk and a future 3D latent that decodes into a dense pointmap. By explicitly predicting how the 3D scene will evolve together with the action sequence, the policy gains strong spatial understanding and predictive capability using only RGB observations. We evaluate our method both in simulation on the RoboTwin benchmark and in real-world robot executions. Our approach consistently outperforms 2D-based and point-cloud-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in manipulation success, inter-arm coordination, and 3D spatial prediction accuracy.

This involves investigating the utility of datasets across multiple downstream tasks rather than focusing on a single task. Prior surveys typically catalogue datasets for a single task, leaving comprehensive cross-task profiling as an open opportunity. Therefore, we propose Task-Lens, a cross-task survey that assesses the readiness of 50 Indian speech datasets spanning 26 languages for nine downstream speech tasks. First, we analyze which datasets contain metadata and properties suitable for specific tasks. Next, we propose task-aligned enhancements to unlock datasets to their full downstream potential. Finally, we identify tasks and Indian languages that are critically underserved by current resources. Our findings reveal that many Indian speech datasets contain untapped metadata that can support multiple downstream tasks. By uncovering cross-task linkages and gaps, Task-Lens enables researchers to explore the broader applicability of existing datasets and to prioritize dataset creation for underserved tasks and languages."}

We introduce an exemplar-free continual learning framework for WSI-to-report generation that avoids storing raw slides or patch exemplars. The core idea is a compact domain footprint built in a frozen patch-embedding space: a small codebook of representative morphology tokens together with slide-level co-occurrence summaries and lightweight patch-count priors. These footprints support generative replay by synthesizing pseudo-WSI representations that reflect domain-specific morphological mixtures, while a teacher snapshot provides pseudo-reports to supervise the updated model without retaining past data. To address shifting reporting conventions, we distill domain-specific linguistic characteristics into a compact style descriptor and use it to steer generation. At inference, the model identifies the most compatible descriptor directly from the slide signal, enabling domain-agnostic setup without requiring explicit domain identifiers. Evaluated across multiple public continual learning benchmarks, our approach outperforms exemplar-free and limited-buffer rehearsal baselines, highlighting footprint-based generative replay as a practical solution for deployment in evolving clinical settings."}

The method summarizes hidden activations via a Gram matrix and applies ridge regression to linearly reconstruct the original hidden representation from the reduced one. The resulting reconstruction map is absorbed into the downstream projection weights, while the upstream layer is compressed. The approach is selector-agnostic (Magnitude, Wanda, Gram-based selection, or folding), data-aware (requiring only a few forward passes without gradients or labels), and recovers classic pruning or folding when the Gram matrix is near identity, indicating weak inter-channel correlations.

For unary fixed-frequency encodings, circuit depth scales as O(omega_max * (omega_max + epsilon^{-2})) with target frequency magnitude omega_max and precision epsilon. Trainable-frequency approaches theoretically reduce this to match the target spectrum size, requiring only as many encoding gates as frequencies in the target spectrum. Despite this compelling efficiency, their practical effectiveness hinges on a key assumption: that gradient-based optimization can drive prefactors to arbitrary target values. We demonstrate through systematic experiments that frequency prefactors exhibit limited trainability: movement is constrained to approximately +/-1 units with typical learning rates. When target frequencies lie outside this reachable range, optimization frequently fails. To overcome this frequency reachability limitation, we propose grid-based initialization using ternary encodings, which generate dense integer frequency spectra. While this approach requires O(log_3(omega_max)) encoding gates -- more than the theoretical optimum but exponentially fewer than fixed-frequency methods -- it ensures target frequencies lie within the locally reachable range. On synthetic targets with three shifted high frequencies, ternary grid initialization achieves a median R^2 score of 0.9969, compared to 0.1841 for the trainable-frequency baseline.

While progressive vision token pruning offers a promising solution, current methods misinterpret shallow layer functions and use rigid schedules, which fail to unlock the full efficiency potential. To address these issues, we propose HiDrop, a framework that aligns token pruning with the true hierarchical function of MLLM layers. HiDrop features two key innovations: (1) Late Injection, which bypasses passive shallow layers to introduce visual tokens exactly where active fusion begins; and (2) Concave Pyramid Pruning with an Early Exit mechanism to dynamically adjust pruning rates across middle and deep layers. This process is optimized via an inter-layer similarity measure and a differentiable top-k operator. To ensure practical efficiency, HiDrop further incorporates persistent positional encoding, FlashAttention-compatible token selection, and parallel decoupling of vision computation to eliminate hidden overhead associated with dynamic token reduction. Extensive experiments show that HiDrop compresses about 90% visual tokens while matching the original performance and accelerating training by 1.72 times.

Yet, LiDAR fails under smoke, dust, and aerosols, whereas FMCW radars remain compact, lightweight, cost-effective, and robust in these situations. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage MRIO framework that combines an IMU bias estimator for resilient localization and mapping in GPS-denied subterranean environments affected by smoke. Radar-based ego-velocity estimation is formulated through a least-squares approach and incorporated into an EKF for online IMU bias correction; the corrected IMU accelerations are fused with heterogeneous measurements from multiple radars and an IMU to refine odometry.

First, we introduce a learnable large-kernel denoising module for input pre-processing, producing cleaner representations and more discriminative features across diverse ship types. Second, we design a feature extraction enhancement strategy based on the PPA attention mechanism to strengthen multi-scale modeling and improve sensitivity to small ships. Third, we incorporate a Gaussian similarity loss derived from the normalized Wasserstein distance (NWD) to better measure similarity under complex bounding-box distributions and improve generalization. Extensive experiments on HRSID and SSDD demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SSDD, CPN-YOLO surpasses the YOLOv8 baseline, achieving 97.0% precision, 95.1% recall, and 98.9% mAP, and consistently outperforms other representative deep-learning detectors in overall performance."}

To address this dual non-disclosure constraint, we propose MPU, an algorithm-agnostic privacy-preserving Multiple Perturbed Copies Unlearning framework that primarily introduces two server-side modules: Pre-Process for randomized copy generation and Post-Process for update aggregation. In Pre-Process, the server distributes multiple perturbed and reparameterized model instances, allowing the client to execute unlearning locally on its private forget set without accessing the server's exact original parameters. After local unlearning, the server performs Post-Process by inverting the reparameterization and aggregating updates with a harmonic denoising procedure to alleviate the impact of perturbation. Experiments with seven unlearning algorithms show that MPU achieves comparable unlearning performance to noise-free baselines, with most algorithms' average degradation well below 1% under 10% noise, and can even outperform the noise-free baseline for some algorithms under 1% noise.

While token pruning offers a path to efficiency, existing methods are fragmented. They typically prune the search region, dynamic template, and static template in isolation, overlooking critical inter-component dependencies, which yields suboptimal pruning and degraded accuracy. To address this, we introduce UTPTrack, a simple and Unified Token Pruning framework that, for the first time, jointly compresses all three components. UTPTrack employs an attention-guided, token type-aware strategy to holistically model redundancy, a design that seamlessly supports unified tracking across multimodal and language-guided tasks within a single model. Extensive evaluations on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that UTPTrack achieves a new state-of-the-art in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for pruning-based trackers, pruning 65.4% of vision tokens in RGB-based tracking and 67.5% in unified tracking while preserving 99.7% and 100.5% of baseline performance, respectively. This strong performance across both RGB and multimodal scenarios underlines its potential as a robust foundation for future research in efficient visual tracking.

Sensing the full shape of a vine robot's body is helpful both for localizing information from other sensors placed along the robot body and for determining the robot's configuration within the space being explored. Prior approaches have localized vine robot tips using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) combined with force sensing or length estimation, while one method demonstrated full-body shape sensing using distributed IMUs on a passively steered robot in controlled maze environments. However, the accuracy of distributed IMU-based shape sensing under active steering, varying robot lengths, and different sensor spacings has not been systematically quantified. In this work, we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of vine robot shape sensing using distributed IMUs along the robot body. We quantify IMU drift, measuring an average orientation drift rate of 1.33 degrees/min across 15 sensors. For passive steering, mean tip position error was 11% of robot length. For active steering, mean tip position error increased to 16%. During growth experiments across lengths from 30-175 cm, mean tip error was 8%, with a positive trend with increasing length. We also analyze the influence of sensor spacing and observe that intermediate spacings can minimize error for single-curvature shapes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed IMU-based shape sensing for vine robots while highlighting key limitations and opportunities for improved modeling and algorithmic integration for field deployment."}

Through extensive empirical observation, we have recognized the critical impact of perception. In particular, when perception ability is almost fixed, enhancing reasoning from Qwen3-8B to OpenAI-o3 yields only 0.7% performance improvement. Conversely, even minimal change in perception model scale (from 7B to 32B) boosts performance by 1.4%, indicating enhancing perception, rather than reasoning, is more critical to improve performance. Therefore, exploring how to enhance perception ability through reasoning without the need for expensive fine-grained annotation information is worthwhile. To achieve this goal, we specially propose APPO, the Attention-guided Perception Policy Optimization algorithm that leverages token-level dense rewards to improve model's fine-grained perception. The core idea behind APPO is to optimize those tokens from different responses that primarily focus on the same crucial video frame (called intra-group perception tokens). Experimental results on diverse video benchmarks and models with different scales (3/7B) demonstrate APPO consistently outperforms GRPO and DAPO (0.5%~4%). We hope our work provides a promising approach to effectively enhance model's perception abilities through reasoning in a low-cost manner, serving diverse scenarios and demands."}

In contrast, the initialization of the critic network has received little attention, despite its central role in policy optimization. This paper proposes a pretraining approach for actor-critic algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that uses expert demonstrations to initialize both networks. The actor is pretrained via behavioral cloning, while the critic is pretrained using returns obtained from rollouts of the pretrained policy. The approach is evaluated on 15 simulated robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks.

While recent layout generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they frequently fail to align with nuanced human aesthetic judgment. Existing preference datasets and reward models trained on text-to-image generation do not generalize to layout evaluation, where the spatial arrangement of identical elements determines quality. To address this critical gap, we introduce DesignSense-10k, a large-scale dataset of 10,235 human-annotated preference pairs for graphic layout evaluation. We propose a five-stage curation pipeline that generates visually coherent layout transformations across diverse aspect ratios, using semantic grouping, layout prediction, filtering, clustering, and VLM-based refinement to produce high-quality comparison pairs. Human preferences are annotated using a 4-class scheme (left, right, both good, both bad) to capture subjective ambiguity. Leveraging this dataset, we train DesignSense, a vision-language model-based classifier that substantially outperforms existing open-source and proprietary models across comprehensive evaluation metrics (54.6% improvement in Macro F1 over the strongest proprietary baseline). Our analysis shows that frontier VLMs remain unreliable overall and fail catastrophically on the full four-class task, underscoring the need for specialized, preference-aware models. Beyond the dataset, our reward model DesignSense yields tangible downstream gains in layout generation. Using our judge during RL based training improves generator win rate by about 3%, while inference-time scaling, which involves generating multiple candidates and selecting the best one, provides a 3.6% improvement. These results highlight the practical impact of specialized, layout-aware preference modeling on real-world layout generation quality."}

While prior works (e.g., Xie et al., 2021) have established the theoretical foundations of learning a good policy from offline data via pessimism, existing algorithms that are computationally tractable (often in an oracle-efficient sense), such as PSPI, only apply to finite and small action spaces. Moreover, these algorithms rely on state-wise mirror descent and require actors to be implicitly induced from the critic functions, failing to accommodate standalone policy parameterization which is ubiquitous in practice. In this work, we address these limitations and extend the theoretical guarantees to parameterized policy classes over large or continuous action spaces. When extending mirror descent to parameterized policies, we identify contextual coupling as the core difficulty, and show how connecting mirror descent to natural policy gradient leads to novel analyses, guarantees, and algorithmic insights, including a surprising unification between offline RL and imitation learning."}

We argue that these limitations reflect structural properties of the supervision channel rather than model scale or optimization. We develop a unified theory showing that whenever the human supervision channel is not sufficient for a latent evaluation target, it acts as an information-reducing channel that induces a strictly positive excess-risk floor for any learner dominated by it. We formalize this Human-Bounded Intelligence limit and show that across six complementary frameworks (operator theory, PAC-Bayes, information theory, causal inference, category theory, and game-theoretic analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback), non-sufficiency yields strictly positive lower bounds arising from the same structural decomposition into annotation noise, preference distortion, and semantic compression. The theory explains why scaling alone cannot eliminate persistent human-aligned errors and characterizes conditions under which auxiliary non-human signals (e.g., retrieval, program execution, tools) increase effective supervision capacity and collapse the floor by restoring information about the latent target. Experiments on real preference data, synthetic known-target tasks, and externally verifiable benchmarks confirm the predicted structural signatures: human-only supervision exhibits a persistent floor, while sufficiently informative auxiliary channels strictly reduce or eliminate excess error."}

While KL divergence and acceptance rate share the same global optimum, small draft models, having limited capacity, typically converge to suboptimal solutions where minimizing KL does not guarantee maximizing acceptance rate. To address this issue, we propose LK losses, special training objectives that directly target acceptance rate. Comprehensive experiments across four draft architectures and six target models, ranging from 8B to 685B parameters, demonstrate consistent improvements in acceptance metrics across all configurations compared to the standard KL-based training. We evaluate our approach on general, coding and math domains and report gains of up to 8-10% in average acceptance length.

For instance, datasets that include perception information generally lack planning data, while planning datasets typically consist of extensive driving sequences where the ego vehicle predominantly drives forward, offering limited behavioral diversity. In addition, many real datasets struggle to evaluate their models, especially for planning tasks, since they lack a proper closed-loop evaluation setup.

Our approach utilizes transformer-based models to fuse multi-camera sensor data into a comprehensive Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling accurate 360-degree 3D object detection. The computation is dynamically split between the vehicle and the cloud based on the number of layers processed locally and the quantization level of the features. To further reduce network load, we apply feature vector clipping and compression prior to transmission. In a real-world experimental evaluation, our hybrid strategy achieved a 72 \\% reduction in end-to-end latency compared to a traditional onboard solution. To adapt to fluctuating network conditions, we introduce a dynamic optimization algorithm that selects the split point and quantization level to maximize detection accuracy while satisfying real-time latency constraints. Trace-based evaluation under realistic bandwidth variability shows that this adaptive approach improves accuracy by up to 20 \\% over static parameterization with the same latency performance."}

In contrast, outpatient prescriptions form renewal-based trajectories that provide a continuous signal of disease management. We propose a probabilistic framework to infer chronic treatment onset by modeling prescription dynamics as a renewal process and detecting transitions from sporadic to sustained therapy via change-point detection between a baseline Poisson (sporadic prescribing) regime and a regime-specific Weibull (sustained therapy) renewal model. Using a nationwide ePrescription dataset of 2.4 million individuals, we show that the approach yields more temporally plausible onset estimates than naive rule-based triggering, substantially reducing implausible early detections under strong left censoring. Detection performance varies across diseases and is strongly associated with prescription density, highlighting both the strengths and limits of treatment-based onset inference."}

Clustered FL tackles this by grouping similar clients. However, existing clustered FL approaches rely solely on either data similarity or gradient similarity; however, this results in an incomplete assessment of client similarities. Prior clustered FL approaches also restrict knowledge and representation sharing to clients within the same cluster. This prevents cluster models from benefiting from the diverse client population across clusters. To address these limitations, FedDAG introduces a clustered FL framework, FedDAG, that employs a weighted, class-wise similarity metric that integrates both data and gradient information, providing a more holistic measure of similarity during clustering. In addition, FedDAG adopts a dual-encoder architecture for cluster models, comprising a primary encoder trained on its own clients' data and a secondary encoder refined using gradients from complementary clusters. This enables cross-cluster feature transfer while preserving cluster-specific specialization. Experiments on diverse benchmarks and data heterogeneity settings show that FedDAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustered FL baselines in accuracy."}

Therefore, minimizing the sharpness of the local loss surfaces on the client data does not enable the effectiveness of SAM in FL to improve the generalization ability of the global model.

This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space.

Moreover, compressing these information-rich pages into a limited visual token budget further increases the risk of hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AgenticOCR, a dynamic parsing paradigm that transforms optical character recognition (OCR) from a static, full-text process into a query-driven, on-demand extraction system. By autonomously analyzing document layout in a \"thinking with images\" manner, AgenticOCR identifies and selectively recognizes regions of interest. This approach performs on-demand decompression of visual tokens precisely where needed, effectively decoupling retrieval granularity from rigid page-level chunking. AgenticOCR has the potential to serve as the \"third building block\" of the visual document RAG stack, operating alongside and enhancing standard Embedding and Reranking modules.

We introduce Ref-Adv, a modern REC benchmark that suppresses shortcuts by pairing linguistically nontrivial expressions with only the information necessary to uniquely identify the target. The dataset contains referring expressions on real images, curated with hard distractors and annotated with reasoning facets including negation. We conduct comprehensive ablations (word order perturbations and descriptor deletion sufficiency) to show that solving Ref-Adv requires reasoning beyond simple cues, and we evaluate a broad suite of contemporary multimodal LLMs on Ref-Adv. Despite strong results on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, models drop markedly on Ref-Adv, revealing reliance on shortcuts and gaps in visual reasoning and grounding. We provide an in depth failure analysis and aim for Ref-Adv to guide future work on visual reasoning and grounding in MLLMs."}

Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) address this by mapping inputs to human-interpretable concept representations from which tasks can be predicted. Yet, CEMs fail to represent inter-concept relationships and require concept annotations at different granularities during training, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Concept Embedding Models (HiCEMs), a new family of CEMs that explicitly model concept relationships through hierarchical structures. To enable HiCEMs in real-world settings, we propose Concept Splitting, a method for automatically discovering finer-grained sub-concepts from a pretrained CEM's embedding space without requiring additional annotations. This allows HiCEMs to generate fine-grained explanations from limited concept labels, reducing annotation burdens. Our evaluation across multiple datasets, including a user study and experiments on PseudoKitchens, a newly proposed concept-based dataset of 3D kitchen renders, demonstrates that (1) Concept Splitting discovers human-interpretable sub-concepts absent during training that can be used to train highly accurate HiCEMs, and (2) HiCEMs enable powerful test-time concept interventions at different granularities, leading to improved task accuracy."}

Our framework models screening and diagnosis as a two-stage, selective decision-making process. A lightweight `screening clinic' agent, restricted to classification models as tools, selectively filters out benign and normal cases from further diagnostic escalation when malignancy risk and uncertainty are estimated as low. Cases that have higher risks are escalated to the `diagnostic clinic' agent, which integrates richer perception and radiological description tools to make a secondary decision on biopsy referral. To improve agent performance, past records of pathology-confirmed outcomes along with image embeddings, model predictions, and historical agent actions are stored in a memory bank as structured decision trajectories. For each new case, BUSD-Agent retrieves similar past cases based on image, model response and confidence similarity to condition the agent's current decision policy. This enables retrieval-conditioned in-context adaptation that dynamically adjusts model trust and escalation thresholds from prior experiences without parameter updates. Evaluation across 10 breast ultrasound datasets shows that the proposed experience-guided workflow reduces diagnostic escalation in BUSD-Agent from 84.95% to 58.72% and overall biopsy referrals from 59.50% to 37.08%, compared to the same architecture without trajectory conditioning, while improving average screening specificity by 68.48% and diagnostic specificity by 6.33%."}

There exist some recent learning based approaches to this problem, but its formulation from the perspective of variational inference remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a variational inference framework for learning parallel generation orders for MDMs. As part of our method, we propose a parameterisation for the approximate posterior of generation orders which facilitates parallelism and efficient sampling during training. Using this method, we conduct preliminary experiments on the GSM8K dataset, where our method performs competitively against heuristic sampling strategies in the regime of highly parallel generation. For example, our method achieves 33.1\\% accuracy with an average of only only 4 generation steps, compared to 23.7-29.0\\% accuracy achieved by standard competitor methods in the same number of steps. We believe further experiments and analysis of the method will yield valuable insights into the problem of parallel generation with MDMs."}

Inspired by cycle consistency, widely used in image distribution modeling, we devise an inverse view transformation (IVT) network that maps BEV segmentation maps back to PV segmentation maps and use it to regularize VT networks during training through cycle consistency losses, enabling them to capture richer semantic and geometric information from input PV images. To further exploit the capacity of the IVT network, we introduce two novel ideas that extend cycle consistency into geometric and representation spaces. We evaluate CycleBEV on four representative VT models covering three major paradigms using the large-scale nuScenes dataset. Experimental results show consistent improvements -- with gains of up to 0.74, 4.86, and 3.74 mIoU for drivable area, vehicle, and pedestrian classes, respectively -- without increasing inference complexity, since the IVT network is used only during training.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x.

At its core, the network introduces a novel \\emph{point-to-hyperplane} fully connected layer (FC), replacing traditional Euclidean affine logits with closed-form hyperbolic distances from features to learned Lorentz hyperplanes, thereby ensuring that the resulting geometric decision functions respect the inherent curvature. Around this fundamental layer, we design intrinsic modules: GyroLBN, a Lorentz batch normalization that couples gyro-centering with gyro-scaling, consistently outperforming both LBN and GyroBN while reducing training time. We additionally proposed a gyro-additive bias for the FC output, a Lorentz patch-concatenation operator that aligns the expected log-radius across feature blocks via a digamma-based scale, and a Lorentz dropout layer.

However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by \"pasting\" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments."}

We call such cases half-truths. On COCO, CLIP prefers the correct shorter description only 40.6% of the time, and performance drops to 32.9% when the added detail is a relation. We trace this vulnerability to weak supervision on caption parts: contrastive training aligns full sentences but does not explicitly enforce that individual entities and relations are grounded. We propose CS-CLIP (Component-Supervised CLIP), which decomposes captions into entity and relation units, constructs a minimally edited foil for each unit, and fine-tunes the model to score the correct unit above its foil while preserving standard dual-encoder inference.

Neuroimaging modalities, such as structural MRI, provide biomarkers of this transition; however, their high costs and infrastructure needs limit their deployment at a population scale. Speech analysis offers a non-invasive alternative, but speech-only classifiers are developed independently of neuroimaging, leaving decision boundaries biologically ungrounded and limiting reliability on the subtle CN-versus-MCI distinction. We propose MINT (Multimodal Imaging-to-Speech Knowledge Transfer), a three-stage cross-modal framework that transfers biomarker structure from MRI into a speech encoder at training time. An MRI teacher, trained on 1,228 subjects, defines a compact neuroimaging embedding space for CN-versus-MCI classification. A residual projection head aligns speech representations to this frozen imaging manifold via a combined geometric loss, adapting speech to the learned biomarker space while preserving imaging encoder fidelity. The frozen MRI classifier, which is never exposed to speech, is applied to aligned embeddings at inference and requires no scanner. Evaluation on ADNI-4 shows aligned speech achieves performance comparable to speech-only baselines (AUC 0.720 vs 0.711) while requiring no imaging at inference, demonstrating that MRI-derived decision boundaries can ground speech representations. Multimodal fusion improves over MRI alone (0.973 vs 0.958). Ablation studies identify dropout regularization and self-supervised pretraining as critical design decisions.

Such approaches depend on large-scale parameter updates, are resource intensive, and can perturb pretrained representations. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that independently trained foundation models may already exhibit latent semantic compatibility, reflecting shared structures in the data they model. This raises a fundamental question: can cross-modal alignment be achieved without modifying the models themselves? Here we introduce HDFLIM (HyperDimensional computing with Frozen Language and Image Models), a framework that establishes cross-modal mappings while keeping pretrained vision and language models fully frozen. HDFLIM projects unimodal embeddings into a shared hyperdimensional space and leverages lightweight symbolic operations -- binding, bundling, and similarity-based retrieval to construct associative cross-modal representations in a single pass over the data. Caption generation emerges from high-dimensional memory retrieval rather than iterative gradient-based optimization. We show that HDFLIM achieves performance comparable to end-to-end vision-language training methods and produces captions that are more semantically grounded than zero-shot baselines. By decoupling alignment from parameter tuning, our results suggest that semantic mapping across foundation models can be realized through symbolic operations on hyperdimensional encodings of the respective embeddings. More broadly, this work points toward an alternative paradigm for foundation model alignment in which frozen models are integrated through structured representational mappings rather than through large-scale retraining.

To address these issues, we propose GPU-SDF, a neural implicit framework for indoor surface reconstruction that leverages geometric prior uncertainty and complementary constraints. We introduce a self-supervised module that explicitly estimates prior uncertainty without auxiliary networks. Based on this estimation, we design an uncertainty-guided loss that modulates prior influence rather than discarding it, thereby retaining weak but informative cues. To address regions with high prior uncertainty, GPU-SDF further incorporates two complementary constraints: an edge distance field that strengthens boundary supervision and a multi-view consistency regularization that enforces geometric coherence. Extensive experiments confirm that GPU-SDF improves the reconstruction of fine details and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing frameworks.

First, we show that under certain alignment and concentration assumptions, projections of the high-dimensional representation asymptotically approach a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Next, under less strict assumptions, we show that adding a small asymptotically vanishing regularization term that promotes low feature norm and high feature entropy leads to similar asymptotic results. We support our analysis with experiments on synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets across multiple encoder architectures and sizes, demonstrating consistent Gaussian behavior.

Yet most approaches rely on pointwise reward estimates that overlook the epistemic uncertainty in reward models arising from limited human feedback. Recent work suggests that quantifying this uncertainty can reduce the costs of human annotation via uncertainty-guided active learning and mitigate reward overoptimization in LLM post-training. However, uncertainty-aware reward models have so far been adopted without thorough comparison, leaving them poorly understood. This work introduces a unified framework, RewardUQ, to systematically evaluate uncertainty quantification for reward models. We compare common methods along standard metrics measuring accuracy and calibration, and we propose a new ranking strategy incorporating both dimensions for a simplified comparison. Our experimental results suggest that model size and initialization have the most meaningful impact on performance, and most prior work could have benefited from alternative design choices. To foster the development and evaluation of new methods and aid the deployment in downstream applications, we release our open-source framework as a Python package.

Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge.

Current knowledge conflict mitigation methods primarily adapted from language-based approaches, focusing on context-level conflicts through engineered prompting strategies or context-aware decoding mechanisms.

Specifically, ACWI introduces a lightweight Beta Network that predicts the intrinsic reward weight directly from the agent state through an encoder based architecture. The scaling mechanism is optimized using a correlation based objective that encourages alignment between the weighted intrinsic rewards and discounted future extrinsic returns. This formulation enables task adaptive exploration incentives while preserving computational efficiency and training stability. We evaluate ACWI on a suite of sparse reward environments in MiniGrid.

A Benchmark on EHR and Chest X-Ray Fusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning holds promise for advancing clinical decision support, yet it remains unclear when multimodal learning truly helps in practice, particularly under modality missingness and fairness constraints. In this work, we conduct a systematic benchmark of multimodal fusion between Electronic Health Records (EHR) and chest X-rays (CXR) on standardized cohorts from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR, aiming to answer four fundamental questions: when multimodal fusion improves clinical prediction, how different fusion strategies compare, how robust existing methods are to missing modalities, and whether multimodal models achieve algorithmic fairness. Our study reveals several key insights. Multimodal fusion improves performance when modalities are complete, with gains concentrating in diseases that require complementary information from both EHR and CXR. While cross-modal learning mechanisms capture clinically meaningful dependencies beyond simple concatenation, the rich temporal structure of EHR introduces strong modality imbalance that architectural complexity alone cannot overcome. Under realistic missingness, multimodal benefits rapidly degrade unless models are explicitly designed to handle incomplete inputs. Moreover, multimodal fusion does not inherently improve fairness, with subgroup disparities mainly arising from unequal sensitivity across demographic groups. To support reproducible and extensible evaluation, we further release a flexible benchmarking toolkit that enables plug-and-play integration of new models and datasets. Together, this work provides actionable guidance on when multimodal learning helps, when it fails, and why, laying the foundation for developing clinically deployable multimodal systems that are both effective and reliable.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a harvesting framework using a new amodal segmentation model, GDA-YOLO11, which incorporates architectural improvements and an updated asymmetric mask loss. The proposed model is trained on a modified version of a public citrus dataset and evaluated on both the base dataset and occlusion-sensitive subsets with varying occlusion levels. Within the framework, full fruit masks, including invisible regions, are inferred by GDA-YOLO11, and picking points are subsequently estimated using the Euclidean distance transform. These points are then projected into 3D coordinates for robotic harvesting execution. Experiments were conducted using real citrus fruits in a controlled environment simulating occlusion scenarios. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first practical demonstration of amodal instance segmentation in robotic fruit harvesting. GDA-YOLO11 achieves a precision of 0.844, recall of 0.846, mAP@50 of 0.914, and mAP@50:95 of 0.636, outperforming YOLO11n by 5.1%, 1.3%, and 1.0% in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95, respectively. The framework attains harvesting success rates of 92.59%, 85.18%, 48.14%, and 22.22% at zero to high occlusion levels, improving success by 3.5% under medium and high occlusion. These findings demonstrate that GDA-YOLO11 enhances occlusion robust segmentation and streamlines perception-to-action integration, paving the way for more reliable autonomous systems in agriculture."}

Our key theoretical result, based on enlargement of filtrations, shows that conditioning on point process observations preserves the diffusion structure of the latent intensity with an explicit drift correction. This guarantees the variational family contains the true posterior, so that ELBO maximization coincides with maximum likelihood estimation under sufficient model capacity. We design an amortized encoder architecture that maps variable-length event sequences to posterior intensity paths by simulating the drift-corrected SDE, replacing repeated MCMC runs with a single forward pass.

In this paper, we introduce DeepLookEditBench (DLEBench), the first benchmark dedicated to assessing the abilities of IIEMs in editing small-scale objects. Specifically, we construct a challenging testbed comprising 1889 samples across seven instruction types. In these samples, target objects occupy only 1%-10% of the image area, covering complex scenarios such as partial occlusion and multi-object editing. To ensure robust evaluation on this benchmark, we propose an evaluation protocol with refined score rubrics to minimize subjectivity and ambiguity in two criteria: Instruction Following and Visual Consistency. This protocol also introduces a dual-mode evaluation framework (Tool-driven and Oracle-guided Modes) addressing the misalignment between LMM-as-a-Judge and human judgements on DLEBench. Empirical results on 10 IIEMs reveal significant performance gaps in small-scale object editing, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks to advance this ability."}

Our key insight is that uniform prompt injection across time ignores the correspondence between events and frames. To this end, we introduce Event-Aligned Query Steering (EAQS), which steers frame-level attention to align with relevant event prompts. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Balance Strength Solver (ABSS), which adaptively balances steering strength to preserve temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SwitchCraft substantially improves prompt alignment, event clarity, and scene consistency compared with existing baselines, offering a simple yet effective solution for multi-event video generation."}

We first introduce FlexBench, a strictness-adaptive LLM moderation benchmark that enables controlled evaluation under multiple strictness regimes. Experiments on FlexBench reveal substantial cross-strictness inconsistency in existing moderators: models that perform well under one regime can degrade substantially under others, limiting their practical usability. To address this, we propose FlexGuard, an LLM-based moderator that outputs a calibrated continuous risk score reflecting risk severity and supports strictness-specific decisions via thresholding. We train FlexGuard via risk-alignment optimization to improve score-severity consistency and provide practical threshold selection strategies to adapt to target strictness at deployment. Experiments on FlexBench and public benchmarks demonstrate that FlexGuard achieves higher moderation accuracy and substantially improved robustness under varying strictness.

NV-CoT expands the MLLM action space from discrete vocabulary tokens to a continuous Euclidean space, allowing models to directly generate bounding-box coordinates as actions with only minimal architectural modification. The framework supports both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we replace categorical token policies with a Gaussian (or Laplace) policy over coordinates and introduce stochasticity via reparameterized sampling, making NV-CoT fully compatible with GRPO-style policy optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks against eight representative visual reasoning baselines demonstrate that NV-CoT significantly improves localization precision and final answer accuracy, while also accelerating training convergence, validating the effectiveness of continuous-action visual reasoning in MLLMs. The code is available in https://github.com/kesenzhao/NV-CoT."}

In practice, however, a discrepancy between the factor-wise averaging used to preserve low rank and the mathematically correct aggregation of local updates can cause significant aggregation error and unstable training. We argue that a major source of this problem is rotational misalignment, arising from the rotational invariance of low-rank factorizations -- semantically equivalent updates can be represented in different latent subspaces across clients since $(B_i R_i)(R_i^\\top A_i) = B_i A_i$. When such misaligned factors are averaged directly, they interfere destructively and degrade the global update. To address this issue, we propose FedRot-LoRA, a federated LoRA framework that aligns client updates via orthogonal transformations prior to aggregation. This alignment preserves the semantic update while reducing cross-client subspace mismatch, without increasing communication cost or restricting model expressivity. We provide a convergence analysis that examines the aggregation error induced by factor-wise averaging and shows how rotational alignment yields a tighter upper bound on this error. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrate that FedRot-LoRA consistently outperforms existing federated LoRA baselines across a range of heterogeneity levels and LoRA ranks."}

Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikeTrack achieves the state-of-the-art among SNN-based trackers and remains competitive with advanced ANN trackers. Notably, it surpasses TransT on LaSOT dataset while consuming only 1/26 of its energy. To our knowledge, SpikeTrack is the first spike-driven framework to make RGB tracking both accurate and energy efficient.

Most explainable AI techniques do not extend well to token sequences, where both local and global features matter, because state-of-the-art models, like transformers, tend to focus on global connections. Therefore, existing explainable AI algorithms fail by (i) identifying disparate tokens of importance, or (ii) assigning a large number of tokens a low value of importance. This method for explainable AI for tokens-based classifiers generalizes a mask-based explainable AI algorithm for images. It starts with an Explainer neural network that is trained to create masks to hide information not relevant for classification. Then, the Hadamard product of the mask and the continuous values of the classifier's embedding layer is taken and passed through the classifier, changing the magnitude of the embedding vector but keeping the orientation unchanged. The Explainer is trained for a taxonomic classifier for nucleotide sequences and it is shown that the masked segments are less relevant to classification than the unmasked ones. This method focused on the importance the token as a whole (i.e., a segment of the input sequence), producing a human-readable explanation."}

MedMAP comprises a modality-aware vision-language alignment stage and a fine-tuning stage for multi-organ abnormality detection. During the pre-training stage, the modality-aware encoders implicitly capture the joint modality distribution and improve alignment between visual and textual representations. We then fine-tune the pre-trained vision encoders (while keeping the text encoder frozen) for downstream tasks. To this end, we curated MedMoM-MRI3D, comprising 7,392 3D MRI volume-report pairs spanning twelve MRI modalities and nine abnormalities tailored for various 3D medical analysis tasks.

Without AG capability, they cannot effectively identify distracting regions or optimize compositional balance, thus also struggling in aesthetic cropping, which aims to refine photo composition through reframing after capture. To address this, we introduce AesGuide, the first large-scale AG dataset and benchmark with 10,748 photos annotated with aesthetic scores, analyses, and guidance. Building upon it, we propose Venus, a two-stage framework that first empowers MLLMs with AG capability through progressively complex aesthetic questions and then activates their aesthetic cropping power via CoT-based rationales.

In this paper, we give a new method for constructing low-degree sandwiching polynomials that yield greatly improved degree bounds for several fundamental function classes and marginal distributions. In particular, we obtain degree $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ sandwiching polynomials for functions of $k$ halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution, improving exponentially over the prior $2^{O(k)}$ bound. More broadly, our approach applies to function classes that are low-dimensional and have smooth boundary.\n  In contrast to prior work, our proof is relatively simple and directly uses the smoothness of the target function's boundary to construct sandwiching Lipschitz functions, which are amenable to results from high-dimensional approximation theory. For low-dimensional polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) with respect to Gaussians, we obtain doubly exponential improvements without applying the FT-mollification method of Kane used in the best previous result."}

While Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate this, existing VLM-based TTA methods operate under a closed-set assumption, failing in open-set scenarios where test streams contain both covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) and out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. This leads to a critical difficulty: the model must discriminate unknown csOOD samples to avoid interference while simultaneously adapting to known csID classes for accuracy. Current open-set TTA (OSTTA) methods rely on hard thresholds for separation and entropy minimization for adaptation. These strategies are brittle, often misclassifying ambiguous csOOD samples and inducing overconfident predictions, and their parameter-update mechanism is computationally prohibitive for VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Double-Check Separation (ProtoDCS), a robust framework for OSTTA that effectively separates csID and csOOD samples, enabling safe and efficient adaptation of VLMs to csID data. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel double-check separation mechanism employing probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) verification to replace brittle thresholding; and (2) an evidence-driven adaptation strategy utilizing uncertainty-aware loss and efficient prototype-level updates, mitigating overconfidence and reducing computational overhead.

Some existing works attempt to cache the features to approximate future features. However, they exhibit considerable approximation error under aggressive acceleration rates. We attribute this to their limited expressivity and the failure to account for sampling information. To fill this gap, we propose to learn a lightweight model that incorporates both previous features and sampled tokens, and regresses the average velocity field of feature evolution. The model has moderate complexity that suffices to capture the subtle dynamics while keeping lightweight compared to the original base model. We apply our method, MIGM-Shortcut, to two representative MIGM architectures and tasks.

We formulate this problem as a large-scale Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) task with high-dimensional state spaces and dynamic system behavior. Our method builds on recent theoretical advances in solving constrained RL problems via best-response and no-regret dynamics in zero-sum games, enabling principled minimax policy learning. Policy evaluation on realistic warehouse simulations shows that our approach effectively trades off objectives, and we empirically observe that it learns a single policy that simultaneously satisfies all constraints, even if this is not theoretically guaranteed. We further introduce a theoretical framework to handle the problem of error cancellation, where time-averaged solutions display oscillatory behavior. This method returns a single iterate whose Lagrangian value is close to the minimax value of the game.

However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification. Compared with the strongest baseline using prompt-enhanced GPT, TRIZ-RAGNER yields an absolute F1-score improvement of 7.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented TRIZ knowledge grounding for robust and accurate patent-based contradiction mining."}

We propose an ordinal latent diffusion model for generating color fundus images that explicitly incorporates the ordered structure of DR severity into the generation process. Instead of categorical conditioning, we used a scalar disease representation, enabling a smooth transition between adjacent stages. We evaluated our approach using visual realism metrics and classification-based clinical consistency analysis on the EyePACS dataset. Compared to a standard conditional diffusion model, our model reduced the Fréchet inception distance for four of the five DR stages and increased the quadratic weighted $κ$ from 0.79 to 0.87. Furthermore, interpolation experiments showed that the model captured a continuous spectrum of disease progression learned from ordered, coarse class labels."}

While vision-based gesture recognition has been explored as one method for hands-free teleoperation, its performance often deteriorates under occlusions, lighting variations, and cluttered backgrounds, limiting its applicability in real-world operations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multimodal gesture recognition framework that integrates inertial data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation) from Apple Watches on both wrists with capacitive sensing signals from custom gloves. We design a late fusion strategy based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), which not only enhances recognition performance but also provides interpretability by quantifying modality-specific contributions. To support this research, we introduce a new dataset of 20 distinct gestures inspired by aircraft marshalling signals, comprising synchronized RGB video, IMU, and capacitive sensor data. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to a state-of-the-art vision-based baseline while significantly reducing computational cost, model size, and training time, making it well suited for real-time robot control. We therefore underscore the potential of sensor-based multimodal fusion as a robust and interpretable solution for gesture-driven mobile robot and drone teleoperation."}

In this work, we introduce an interpretable, model-agnostic bias mitigation framework, DeBiasLens, that localizes social attribute neurons in VLMs through sparse autoencoders (SAEs) applied to multimodal encoders. Building upon the disentanglement ability of SAEs, we train them on facial image or caption datasets without corresponding social attribute labels to uncover neurons highly responsive to specific demographics, including those that are underrepresented.

Prior to our work, all positive results in this area made strong restrictions on how models influenced distributions. By using a martingale argument and allowing randomization, we avoid any such assumption and sidestep recent hardness results for finding stable models.

Using uncentered, row-normalized trajectory PCA, we show that a single direction captures a large fraction of cumulative parameter movement early in training, while remaining components encode oscillatory behavior in auxiliary probe performance. Instantaneous gradients exhibit little alignment with this dominant direction, indicating that it arises from accumulated optimizer updates rather than per-batch gradient structure. Comparing AdamW with SGD variants at matched loss levels reveals substantial differences in trajectory geometry: AdamW develops multi-dimensional drift structure, whereas SGD-family optimizers produce nearly colinear parameter evolution and weaker probe dynamics. Reheating selectively perturbs transverse components with minimal effect on the dominant drift coordinate. These findings suggest that optimizer choice shapes the effective dimensionality and structure of learning trajectories beyond what is apparent from loss values alone."}

This severely limits reconstruction fidelity, cross-scene generalization, and real-time usability. We propose to reformulate 3DSR as a direct feed-forward mapping from sparse LR views to HR 3DGS representations, enabling the model to autonomously learn 3D-specific high-frequency geometry and appearance from large-scale, multi-scene data. This fundamentally changes how 3DSR acquires high-frequency knowledge and enables robust generalization to unseen scenes.

To further enhance reconstruction fidelity, we introduce Gaussian offset learning and feature refinement, which stabilize reconstruction and sharpen high-frequency details. SR3R is plug-and-play and can be paired with any feed-forward 3DGS reconstruction backbone: the backbone provides an LR 3DGS scaffold, and SR3R upscales it to an HR 3DGS.

In the context of IoT-based anomaly detection, unsupervised FL offers a promising means to identify abnormal behavior without centralized data aggregation.

Traditional VAD methods generally suffer from the high costs of labeled data and full training, thus some recent works have explored leveraging frozen multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in a tuning-free manner to perform VAD. However, their performance is limited as they directly inherit pre-training biases and cannot adapt internal representations to specific video contexts, leading to difficulties in handling subtle or ambiguous anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel intervention framework, termed SteerVAD, which advances MLLM-based VAD by shifting from passively reading to actively steering and rectifying internal representations. Our approach first leverages the gradient-free representational separability analysis (RSA) to identify top attention heads as latent anomaly experts (LAEs) which are most discriminative for VAD. Then a hierarchical meta-controller (HMC) generates dynamic rectification signals by jointly conditioning on global context and these LAE outputs. The signals execute targeted, anisotropic scaling directly upon the LAE representation manifolds, amplifying anomaly-relevant dimensions while suppressing inherent biases. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free approaches requiring only 1% of training data, establishing it as a powerful new direction for video anomaly detection.

Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks."}

Recent input-side defenses detect unsafe images with CLIP and prepend safety prefixes to prompts, but they still suffer from inaccurate detection in complex scenes and unstable safety signals during decoding. To address these issues, we propose GuardAlign, a training-free defense framework that integrates two strategies. First, OT-enhanced safety detection leverages optimal transport to measure distribution distances between image patches and unsafe semantics, enabling accurate identification of malicious regions without additional computational cost. Second, cross-modal attentive calibration strengthens the influence of safety prefixes by adaptively reallocating attention across layers, ensuring that safety signals remain consistently activated throughout generation. Extensive evaluations on six representative MLLMs demonstrate that GuardAlign reduces unsafe response rates by up to 39% on SPA-VL, while preserving utility, achieving an improvement on VQAv2 from 78.51% to 79.21%."}

While minimizing regret requires repeated exploitation of high-reward arms, accurate inference on reward gaps requires sufficient exploration of suboptimal actions. We formalize this trade-off through the concept of Pareto optimality and establish equivalent conditions for Pareto-efficient learning in CMAB. We consider two relevant cases under different information structures, i.e., full-bandit feedback and semi-bandit feedback, and propose two algorithms MixCombKL and MixCombUCB respectively for these two cases. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both algorithms are Pareto optimal, achieving finite-time guarantees on both regret and estimation error of arm gaps. Our results further reveal that richer feedback significantly tightens the attainable Pareto frontier, with the primary gains arising from improved estimation accuracy under our proposed methods. Taken together, these findings establish a principled framework for adaptive combinatorial experimentation in multi-objective decision-making."}

Existing mitigation strategies either require costly supervision during training or introduce additional latency at inference time. Recent vision enhancement methods attempt to address this issue by reinforcing visual tokens during decoding, but they typically inject all tokens indiscriminately, which causes interference from background regions and distracts the model from critical cues. To overcome this challenge, we propose Adaptive Visual Reinforcement (AIR), a training-free framework for MLLMs. AIR consists of two components. Prototype-based token reduction condenses the large pool of visual tokens into a compact subset to suppress redundancy. OT-guided patch reinforcement quantifies the alignment between hidden states and patch embeddings to selectively integrate the most consistent patches into feed-forward layers. As a result, AIR enhances the model's reliance on salient visual information and effectively mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments across representative MLLMs demonstrate that AIR substantially reduces hallucination while preserving general capabilities, establishing it as an effective solution for building reliable MLLMs."}

Despite significant progress in human body recovery, accurately reconstructing garment geometry, particularly for loose-fitting clothing, remains an open challenge. We propose a unified framework for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from both single images and video sequences. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn expressive garment shape priors in 2D UV space. Leveraging these priors, we introduce a mapping model that establishes correspondences between image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling accurate and detailed garment reconstruction from single images. We further extend this formulation to dynamic reconstruction by introducing a spatio-temporal diffusion scheme with test-time guidance to enforce long-range temporal consistency. We also develop analytic projection-based constraints that preserve image-aligned geometry in visible regions while enforcing coherent completion in occluded areas over time. Although trained exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes well to real-world imagery and consistently outperforms existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments preserve fine geometric detail while exhibiting realistic dynamic motion, supporting downstream applications such as texture editing, garment retargeting, and animation."}

Recent studies have shown that informed heuristics that take the positions/shapes of the obstacles into account can be approximated with the deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the existing learning-based approaches mostly rely on the assumption that training and test grid maps are drawn from the same distribution (e.g., city maps, indoor maps, etc.) and perform poorly on out-of-distribution tasks. This naturally limits their application in practice when often a universal solver is needed that is capable of efficiently handling any problem instance. In this work, we close this gap by designing an universal heuristic predictor: a model trained once, but capable of generalizing across a full spectrum of unseen tasks. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the suggested approach halves the computational effort of A* by up to a factor of 2.2, while still providing solutions within 3% of the optimal cost on average altogether on the tasks that are completely different from the ones used for training $\\unicode{x2013}$ a milestone reached for the first time by a learnable solver."}

In this work, we observe that the distributions and occurrence frequencies of important channels vary significantly both across modalities and among tokens, even within the same modality. Accordingly, we propose \\textbf{Quant Experts (QE)}, a token-aware adaptive error compensation with mixture-of-experts for VLMs quantization. QE divides the important channels into token-independent and token-dependent groups. For the former, a shared expert is designed for most tokens to compensate for global quantization error using a low-rank adapter. For the latter, routed experts including multiple routed low-rank adapters are elaborated to compensate for local quantization error related to specific tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QE consistently enhances task accuracy across various quantization settings and model scales, ranging from 2B to 70B parameters, while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision models."}

In Pre-Process, the server distributes multiple perturbed and reparameterized model instances, allowing the client to execute unlearning locally on its private forget set without accessing the server's exact original parameters. After local unlearning, the server performs Post-Process by inverting the reparameterization and aggregating updates with a harmonic denoising procedure to alleviate the impact of perturbation. Experiments with seven unlearning algorithms show that MPU achieves comparable unlearning performance to noise-free baselines, with most algorithms' average degradation well below 1% under 10% noise, and can even outperform the noise-free baseline for some algorithms under 1% noise.

Sea$^2$ keeps all perception modules frozen, requiring no downstream labels during training, and uses only scalar perceptual feedback to navigate the agent toward informative viewpoints. Specially, we transform a vision-language model (VLM) into a low-level pose controller through a two-stage training pipeline: first fine-tuning it on rule-based exploration trajectories that systematically probe indoor scenes, and then refining the policy via unsupervised reinforcement learning that constructs rewards from the perception module's outputs and confidence. Unlike prior active perception methods that couple exploration with specific models or collect data for retraining them, Sea$^2$ directly leverages off-the-shelf perception models for various tasks without the need for retraining.

Moreover, these algorithms rely on state-wise mirror descent and require actors to be implicitly induced from the critic functions, failing to accommodate standalone policy parameterization which is ubiquitous in practice. In this work, we address these limitations and extend the theoretical guarantees to parameterized policy classes over large or continuous action spaces. When extending mirror descent to parameterized policies, we identify contextual coupling as the core difficulty, and show how connecting mirror descent to natural policy gradient leads to novel analyses, guarantees, and algorithmic insights, including a surprising unification between offline RL and imitation learning."}

To address these challenges, we propose FocusTrack, a novel one-stage paradigms tracking framework that unifies motion-semantics co-modeling through two core innovations: Inter-frame Motion Modeling (IMM) and Focus-and-Suppress Attention.

To address this, we introduce AgenticOCR, a dynamic parsing paradigm that transforms optical character recognition (OCR) from a static, full-text process into a query-driven, on-demand extraction system. By autonomously analyzing document layout in a \"thinking with images\" manner, AgenticOCR identifies and selectively recognizes regions of interest. This approach performs on-demand decompression of visual tokens precisely where needed, effectively decoupling retrieval granularity from rigid page-level chunking. AgenticOCR has the potential to serve as the \"third building block\" of the visual document RAG stack, operating alongside and enhancing standard Embedding and Reranking modules. Experimental results demonstrate that AgenticOCR improves both the efficiency and accuracy of visual RAG systems, achieving expert-level performance in long document understanding.

Our framework models screening and diagnosis as a two-stage, selective decision-making process. A lightweight `screening clinic' agent, restricted to classification models as tools, selectively filters out benign and normal cases from further diagnostic escalation when malignancy risk and uncertainty are estimated as low. Cases that have higher risks are escalated to the `diagnostic clinic' agent, which integrates richer perception and radiological description tools to make a secondary decision on biopsy referral. To improve agent performance, past records of pathology-confirmed outcomes along with image embeddings, model predictions, and historical agent actions are stored in a memory bank as structured decision trajectories. For each new case, BUSD-Agent retrieves similar past cases based on image, model response and confidence similarity to condition the agent's current decision policy. This enables retrieval-conditioned in-context adaptation that dynamically adjusts model trust and escalation thresholds from prior experiences without parameter updates. Evaluation across 10 breast ultrasound datasets shows that the proposed experience-guided workflow reduces diagnostic escalation in BUSD-Agent from 84.95% to 58.72% and overall biopsy referrals from 59.50% to 37.08%, compared to the same architecture without trajectory conditioning, while improving average screening specificity by 68.48% and diagnostic specificity by 6.33%."}

Consequently, effective pruning strategies and more expressive primitives that can reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality are crucial for practical deployment. We propose an efficient, integrated reconstruction-aware pruning strategy that adaptively determines pruning timing and refining intervals based on reconstruction quality, thus reducing model size while enhancing rendering quality.

Recent approaches increasingly rely on large-scale pre-training on thousands of labeled surgical videos, followed by zero-shot transfer to specific procedures. While effective, this strategy incurs substantial computational and data collection costs. In this work, we question whether such heavy pre-training is truly necessary. We propose Text-Augmented Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (TASOT), an unsupervised method for surgical phase and step recognition that extends Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (ASOT) by incorporating textual information generated directly from the videos. TASOT formulates temporal action segmentation as a multimodal optimal transport problem, where the matching cost is defined as a weighted combination of visual and text-based costs. The visual term captures frame-level appearance similarity, while the text term provides complementary semantic cues, and both are jointly regularized through a temporally consistent unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulation. This design enables effective alignment between video frames and surgical actions without surgical-specific pretraining or external web-scale supervision. We evaluate TASOT on multiple benchmark surgical datasets and observe consistent and substantial improvements over existing zero-shot methods, including StrasBypass70 (+23.7), BernBypass70 (+4.5), Cholec80 (+16.5), and AutoLaparo (+19.6).

V-MORALS takes in a dataset of image-based trajectories of a system under a given controller, and learns a latent space for reachability analysis.

These methods bypass intermediate logical steps and consequently suffer from geometric hallucinations. They confidently generate plausible responses that fail to ground in precise structural details. To bridge this gap, we present PointCoT, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for 3D data.

To address these issues, we introduce RETA -- a Retrieval and Topology Alignment framework for decoupled DD. First, Dynamic Retrieval Connection (DRC) selects a real patch from a prebuilt pool by minimizing a fit-complexity score in teacher feature space; the chosen patch is injected via a residual connection to tighten feature fit while controlling injected complexity. Second, Persistent Topology Alignment (PTA) regularizes synthesis with persistent homology: we build a mutual k-NN feature graph, compute persistence images of components and loops, and penalize topology discrepancies between real and synthetic sets, mitigating pull-to-anchor effect. Across CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and multiple ImageNet subsets, RETA consistently outperforms various baselines under comparable time and memory, especially reaching 64.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-18 at 50 images per class, +3.1% over the best prior."}

Furthermore, our framework includes an early exit mechanism that makes our model adaptive and allows to choose the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and computational cost at run-time. For example in a two-branch architecture, the original image is first resized to reduce its resolution, then a prediction is performed on it using a first transformer and the resulting prediction is reused together with the original-size image to perform a final prediction on a second transformer with less computation than a classical Vision transformer architecture. The early-exit process allows the model to make a final prediction at intermediate branches, saving even more computation. We evaluated our approach on CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet.

However, available hierarchical dimensionality reduction methods construct the hierarchy purely based on the attribute information and ignore the spatial layout of pixels in the images. This impedes the exploration of regions of interest in the image space, since there is no congruence between a region of interest in image space and the associated attribute abstractions in the hierarchy. In this paper, we present a superpixel hierarchy for high-dimensional images that takes the high-dimensional attribute manifold into account during construction.

Such approaches depend on large-scale parameter updates, are resource intensive, and can perturb pretrained representations. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that independently trained foundation models may already exhibit latent semantic compatibility, reflecting shared structures in the data they model. This raises a fundamental question: can cross-modal alignment be achieved without modifying the models themselves? Here we introduce HDFLIM (HyperDimensional computing with Frozen Language and Image Models), a framework that establishes cross-modal mappings while keeping pretrained vision and language models fully frozen. HDFLIM projects unimodal embeddings into a shared hyperdimensional space and leverages lightweight symbolic operations -- binding, bundling, and similarity-based retrieval to construct associative cross-modal representations in a single pass over the data. Caption generation emerges from high-dimensional memory retrieval rather than iterative gradient-based optimization. We show that HDFLIM achieves performance comparable to end-to-end vision-language training methods and produces captions that are more semantically grounded than zero-shot baselines. By decoupling alignment from parameter tuning, our results suggest that semantic mapping across foundation models can be realized through symbolic operations on hyperdimensional encodings of the respective embeddings. More broadly, this work points toward an alternative paradigm for foundation model alignment in which frozen models are integrated through structured representational mappings rather than through large-scale retraining.

Neuroimaging modalities, such as structural MRI, provide biomarkers of this transition; however, their high costs and infrastructure needs limit their deployment at a population scale. Speech analysis offers a non-invasive alternative, but speech-only classifiers are developed independently of neuroimaging, leaving decision boundaries biologically ungrounded and limiting reliability on the subtle CN-versus-MCI distinction. We propose MINT (Multimodal Imaging-to-Speech Knowledge Transfer), a three-stage cross-modal framework that transfers biomarker structure from MRI into a speech encoder at training time. An MRI teacher, trained on 1,228 subjects, defines a compact neuroimaging embedding space for CN-versus-MCI classification. A residual projection head aligns speech representations to this frozen imaging manifold via a combined geometric loss, adapting speech to the learned biomarker space while preserving imaging encoder fidelity. The frozen MRI classifier, which is never exposed to speech, is applied to aligned embeddings at inference and requires no scanner. Evaluation on ADNI-4 shows aligned speech achieves performance comparable to speech-only baselines (AUC 0.720 vs 0.711) while requiring no imaging at inference, demonstrating that MRI-derived decision boundaries can ground speech representations.

While diffusion models have enabled remarkable progress in image and video generation for avatar reconstruction, existing methods primarily rely on 2D priors and struggle to achieve consistent 3D geometry. We propose a novel framework that leverages geometry-aware diffusion to learn strong geometry priors for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction. Our approach jointly synthesizes portrait images and corresponding surface normals, while a pose-free expression encoder captures implicit expression representations. Both synthesized images and expression latents are incorporated into 3D Gaussian-based avatars, enabling photorealistic rendering with accurate geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, expression fidelity, and cross-identity generalization, while supporting real-time rendering."}

This paper outlines a vision for foundation world models: persistent, compositional representations that unify reinforcement learning, reactive/program synthesis, and abstraction mechanisms. We propose an agenda built around four components: (i) learnable reward models from specifications to support optimization with clear objectives; (ii) adaptive formal verification integrated throughout learning; (iii) online abstraction calibration to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions; and (iv) test-time synthesis and world-model generation guided by verifiers. Together, these components enable agents to synthesize verifiable programs, derive new policies from a small number of interactions, and maintain correctness while adapting to novelty.

To address this, we propose the Omnivorous Vision Encoder, a novel framework that learns a modality-agnostic feature space. We train the encoder with a dual objective: first, to maximize the feature alignment between different modalities of the same scene; and second, a distillation objective that anchors the learned representations to the output of a fully frozen teacher such as DINOv2. The resulting student encoder becomes \"omnivorous\" by producing a consistent, powerful embedding for a given scene, regardless of the input modality (RGB, Depth, Segmentation, etc.).

To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks."}

In this work, we introduce an interpretable, model-agnostic bias mitigation framework, DeBiasLens, that localizes social attribute neurons in VLMs through sparse autoencoders (SAEs) applied to multimodal encoders. Building upon the disentanglement ability of SAEs, we train them on facial image or caption datasets without corresponding social attribute labels to uncover neurons highly responsive to specific demographics, including those that are underrepresented. By selectively deactivating the social neurons most strongly tied to bias for each group, we effectively mitigate socially biased behaviors of VLMs without degrading their semantic knowledge. Our research lays the groundwork for future auditing tools, prioritizing social fairness in emerging real-world AI systems."}

This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets."}

Our approach utilizes transformer-based models to fuse multi-camera sensor data into a comprehensive Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling accurate 360-degree 3D object detection. The computation is dynamically split between the vehicle and the cloud based on the number of layers processed locally and the quantization level of the features.

In this work, we observe that the distributions and occurrence frequencies of important channels vary significantly both across modalities and among tokens, even within the same modality. Accordingly, we propose \\textbf{Quant Experts (QE)}, a token-aware adaptive error compensation with mixture-of-experts for VLMs quantization. QE divides the important channels into token-independent and token-dependent groups. For the former, a shared expert is designed for most tokens to compensate for global quantization error using a low-rank adapter. For the latter, routed experts including multiple routed low-rank adapters are elaborated to compensate for local quantization error related to specific tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QE consistently enhances task accuracy across various quantization settings and model scales, ranging from 2B to 70B parameters, while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision models."}

MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines.

Our framework models screening and diagnosis as a two-stage, selective decision-making process. A lightweight `screening clinic' agent, restricted to classification models as tools, selectively filters out benign and normal cases from further diagnostic escalation when malignancy risk and uncertainty are estimated as low. Cases that have higher risks are escalated to the `diagnostic clinic' agent, which integrates richer perception and radiological description tools to make a secondary decision on biopsy referral. To improve agent performance, past records of pathology-confirmed outcomes along with image embeddings, model predictions, and historical agent actions are stored in a memory bank as structured decision trajectories. For each new case, BUSD-Agent retrieves similar past cases based on image, model response and confidence similarity to condition the agent's current decision policy.

This provides theoretical grounding for the Linear Representation Hypothesis: the linear structure widely observed in neural representations is a necessary consequence of compositional generalization. We further derive dimension bounds linking the number of composable concepts to the embedding geometry. Empirically, we evaluate these predictions across modern vision models (CLIP, SigLIP, DINO) and find that representations exhibit partial linear factorization with low-rank, near-orthogonal per-concept factors, and that the degree of this structure correlates with compositional generalization on unseen combinations. As models continue to scale, these conditions predict the representational geometry they may converge to. Code is available at https://github.com/oshapio/necessary-compositionality."}

Instead of following fixed plans, construction tasks are defined through targets and obstacles, allowing the system to adapt more flexibly to environmental uncertainty and variations during the building process. A reinforcement learning (RL) policy, trained using deep Q-learning with successor features, serves as the decision-making component. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the approach on a benchmark of 15 2D robotic assembly tasks of discrete block construction. Experiments using a real-world closed-loop robotic setup demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to handle construction noise. The results suggest that our framework offers a promising direction for more adaptable and robust robotic construction in real-world environments."}

This highlights the difficulty of enabling hierarchical reasoning in video understanding. Interestingly, we observe that lower-level visual and high-level action latent variables evolve at different rates, with low-level visual variables changing rapidly, while high-level action variables evolve more slowly, making them easier to identify. Building on this insight, we propose the Hierarchical Action Learning (\\textbf{HAL}) model for weakly-supervised action segmentation. Our approach introduces a hierarchical causal data generation process, where high-level latent action governs the dynamics of low-level visual features. To model these varying timescales effectively, we introduce deterministic processes to align these latent variables over time. The \\textbf{HAL} model employs a hierarchical pyramid transformer to capture both visual features and latent variables, and a sparse transition constraint is applied to enforce the slower dynamics of high-level action variables. This mechanism enhances the identification of these latent variables over time. Under mild assumptions, we prove that these latent action variables are strictly identifiable. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that the \\textbf{HAL} model significantly outperforms existing methods for weakly-supervised action segmentation, confirming its practical effectiveness in real-world applications."}

Our approach utilizes a global Flow Matching head trained via supervised learning on long videos to capture narrative structure, while simultaneously employing a local Distribution Matching head that aligns sliding windows to a frozen short-video teacher via a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence. This strategy enables the synthesis of minute-scale videos that learns long-range coherence and motions from limited long videos via supervised flow matching, while inheriting local realism by aligning every sliding-window segment of the student to a frozen short-video teacher, resulting in a few-step fast long video generator. Evaluations show that our method effectively closes the fidelity-horizon gap by jointly improving local sharpness, motion and long-range consistency.

Standard lexical metrics heavily penalize clinical paraphrasing and fail to capture these deductive failures in reference-free settings. Toward guarantees for clinical reasoning, we introduce a neurosymbolic verification framework that deterministically audits the internal consistency of VLM-generated reports. Our pipeline autoformalizes free-text radiographic findings into structured propositional evidence, utilizing an SMT solver (Z3) and a clinical knowledge base to verify whether each diagnostic claim is mathematically entailed, hallucinated, or omitted. Evaluating seven VLMs across five chest X-ray benchmarks, our verifier exposes distinct reasoning failure modes, such as conservative observation and stochastic hallucination, that remain invisible to traditional metrics. On labeled datasets, enforcing solver-backed entailment acts as a rigorous post-hoc guarantee, systematically eliminating unsupported hallucinations to significantly increase diagnostic soundness and precision in generative clinical assistants."}

We introduce UFO-4D, a unified feedforward framework to reconstruct a dense, explicit 4D representation from just a pair of unposed images. UFO-4D directly estimates dynamic 3D Gaussian Splats, enabling the joint and consistent estimation of 3D geometry, 3D motion, and camera pose in a feedforward manner. Our core insight is that differentiably rendering multiple signals from a single Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation offers major training advantages. This approach enables a self-supervised image synthesis loss while tightly coupling appearance, depth, and motion. Since all modalities share the same geometric primitives, supervising one inherently regularizes and improves the others. This synergy overcomes data scarcity, allowing UFO-4D to outperform prior work by up to 3 times in joint geometry, motion, and camera pose estimation. Our representation also enables high-fidelity 4D interpolation across novel views and time. Please visit our project page for visual results: https://ufo-4d.github.io/"}

The central thesis is that AI is most useful when treated as part of an extended human--tool system that increases sensing, understanding, and actuation capability while reducing friction at the interface between people, tools, and environments. The agenda unifies predictive compression, intrinsic motivation, empowerment and control, interface quality (unification), and language/self-communication as selective information bottlenecks. We formulate these ideas as a falsifiable program with explicit costs, staged experiments, and a concrete multimodal tokenized testbed in which an agent allocates limited budget among observation, action, and deliberation. The aim is to provide a conceptual and experimental framework that connects intrinsic motivation, information theory, thermodynamics, bounded rationality, and modern reasoning systems"}

We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages."}

While recent advances have focused heavily on scaling training data and model capacity, the choice of action space remains guided by ad-hoc heuristics or legacy designs, leading to an ambiguous understanding of robotic policy design philosophies. To address this ambiguity, we conducted a large-scale and systematic empirical study, confirming that the action space does have significant and complex impacts on robotic policy learning. We dissect the action design space along temporal and spatial axes, facilitating a structured analysis of how these choices govern both policy learnability and control stability. Based on 13,000+ real-world rollouts on a bimanual robot and evaluation on 500+ trained models over four scenarios, we examine the trade-offs between absolute vs. delta representations, and joint-space vs. task-space parameterizations. Our large-scale results suggest that properly designing the policy to predict delta actions consistently improves performance, while joint-space and task-space representations offer complementary strengths, favoring control stability and generalization, respectively."}

However, their computational cost is very high compared to alternative approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for image classification called RAViT based on a multi-branch network that operates on several copies of the same image with different resolutions to reduce the computational cost while preserving the overall accuracy. Furthermore, our framework includes an early exit mechanism that makes our model adaptive and allows to choose the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and computational cost at run-time. For example in a two-branch architecture, the original image is first resized to reduce its resolution, then a prediction is performed on it using a first transformer and the resulting prediction is reused together with the original-size image to perform a final prediction on a second transformer with less computation than a classical Vision transformer architecture. The early-exit process allows the model to make a final prediction at intermediate branches, saving even more computation. We evaluated our approach on CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet. We obtained an equivalent accuracy to the classical Vision transformer model with only around 70% of FLOPs."}

Recent approaches increasingly rely on large-scale pre-training on thousands of labeled surgical videos, followed by zero-shot transfer to specific procedures. While effective, this strategy incurs substantial computational and data collection costs. In this work, we question whether such heavy pre-training is truly necessary. We propose Text-Augmented Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (TASOT), an unsupervised method for surgical phase and step recognition that extends Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (ASOT) by incorporating textual information generated directly from the videos. TASOT formulates temporal action segmentation as a multimodal optimal transport problem, where the matching cost is defined as a weighted combination of visual and text-based costs. The visual term captures frame-level appearance similarity, while the text term provides complementary semantic cues, and both are jointly regularized through a temporally consistent unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulation. This design enables effective alignment between video frames and surgical actions without surgical-specific pretraining or external web-scale supervision. We evaluate TASOT on multiple benchmark surgical datasets and observe consistent and substantial improvements over existing zero-shot methods, including StrasBypass70 (+23.7), BernBypass70 (+4.5), Cholec80 (+16.5), and AutoLaparo (+19.6). These results demonstrate that fine-grained surgical understanding can be achieved by exploiting information already present in standard visual and textual representations, without resorting to increasingly complex pre-training pipelines.

However, MORALS still relies on full state knowledge and has not been studied when only sensor measurements are available. This paper presents Visual Morse Graph-Aided Estimation of Regions of Attraction in a Learned Latent Space (V- MORALS). V-MORALS takes in a dataset of image-based trajectories of a system under a given controller, and learns a latent space for reachability analysis. Using this learned latent space, our method is able to generate well-defined Morse Graphs, from which we can compute ROAs for various systems and controllers.

Users must depend on confusing, time-consuming static signage or floor maps. In this paper, an AR-based technique has been applied to campus and small-site navigation, where Vuforia Area Target is used for environment modeling. AI navigation's NavMesh component is used for navigation purposes, and the A* algorithm is used within this component for shortest path calculation. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, it can reach a solution about two to three times faster for smaller search spaces. In many cases, Dijkstra's algorithm has difficulty performing well in high-complexity environments where memory usage grows and processing times increase. Compared to older approaches such as GPS, real-time processing and AR overlays can be combined to provide intuitive directions for users while dynamically updating the path in response to environmental changes. Experimental results indicate significantly improved navigation accuracy, better user experience, and greater efficiency compared to traditional methods. These results show that AR technology integrated with existing pathfinding algorithms is feasible and scalable, making it a user-friendly solution for indoor navigation.

This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models.

However, most existing approaches primarily rely on direct mappings from 2D visual inputs to action sequences, without explicitly modeling the underlying 3D spatial structure or temporal world dynamics. Such representations may limit spatial reasoning and long-horizon decision-making in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we propose StemVLA, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates both future-oriented 3D spatial knowledge and historical 4D spatiotemporal representations into action prediction. First, instead of relying solely on observed images, StemVLA forecasts structured 3D future spatial-geometric world knowledge, enabling the model to anticipate upcoming scene geometry and object configurations. Second, to capture temporal consistency and motion dynamics, we feed historical image frames into a pretrained video-geometry transformer backbone to extract implicit 3D world representations, and further aggregate them across time using a temporal attention module, termed VideoFormer [20], forming a unified 4D historical spatiotemporal representation. By jointly modeling 2D observations, predicted 3D future structure, and aggregated 4D temporal dynamics, StemVLA enables more comprehensive world understanding for robot manipulation. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that StemVLA significantly improves long-horizon task success and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmark [46], achieving an average sequence length of XXX."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive optical knowledge, their capabilities in leveraging the knowledge in designing lens system remain significantly constrained. This work represents the first attempt to employ LLMs in the field of optical design. We bridge the expertise gap by enabling users without formal optical training to successfully develop functional lens systems. Concretely, we curate a comprehensive dataset, named OptiDesignQA, which encompasses both classical lens systems sourced from standard optical textbooks and novel configurations generated by automated design algorithms for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we inject domain-specific optical expertise into the LLM through a hybrid objective of full-system synthesis and lens completion. To align the model with optical principles, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization Done Right (DrGRPO) guided by Optical Lexicographic Reward for physics-driven policy alignment. This reward system incorporates structural format rewards, physical feasibility rewards, light-manipulation accuracy, and LLM-based heuristics. Finally, our model integrates with specialized optical optimization routines for end-to-end fine-tuning and precision refinement.

This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets."}

To address this, we propose the Omnivorous Vision Encoder, a novel framework that learns a modality-agnostic feature space. We train the encoder with a dual objective: first, to maximize the feature alignment between different modalities of the same scene; and second, a distillation objective that anchors the learned representations to the output of a fully frozen teacher such as DINOv2. The resulting student encoder becomes \"omnivorous\" by producing a consistent, powerful embedding for a given scene, regardless of the input modality (RGB, Depth, Segmentation, etc.). This approach enables robust cross-modal understanding while retaining the discriminative semantics of the original foundation model."}

Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks.

In the context of IoT-based anomaly detection, unsupervised FL offers a promising means to identify abnormal behavior without centralized data aggregation. Nevertheless, feature heterogeneity across devices complicates model training and optimization, hindering effective implementation. In this study we propose an efficient unsupervised FL framework that enhances anomaly detection by leveraging shared features from two distinct IoT datasets: one focused on anomaly detection and the other on device identification, while preserving dataset-specific features. To improve transparency and interpretability, we employ explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP, to identify key features influencing local model decisions.

We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities.

First, we construct YE-KG, the first large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal knowledge graph, with over 86k nodes and 83k edges, derived from real-world indoor videos.

Although modern models are trained on massive datasets, they still cover only a tiny fraction of the combinatorial space of possible inputs, raising the question of what structure representations must have to support generalization to unseen combinations. We formalize three desiderata for compositional generalization under standard training (divisibility, transferability, stability) and show they impose necessary geometric constraints: representations must decompose linearly into per-concept components, and these components must be orthogonal across concepts. This provides theoretical grounding for the Linear Representation Hypothesis: the linear structure widely observed in neural representations is a necessary consequence of compositional generalization. We further derive dimension bounds linking the number of composable concepts to the embedding geometry. Empirically, we evaluate these predictions across modern vision models (CLIP, SigLIP, DINO) and find that representations exhibit partial linear factorization with low-rank, near-orthogonal per-concept factors, and that the degree of this structure correlates with compositional generalization on unseen combinations.

Speech analysis offers a non-invasive alternative, but speech-only classifiers are developed independently of neuroimaging, leaving decision boundaries biologically ungrounded and limiting reliability on the subtle CN-versus-MCI distinction. We propose MINT (Multimodal Imaging-to-Speech Knowledge Transfer), a three-stage cross-modal framework that transfers biomarker structure from MRI into a speech encoder at training time. An MRI teacher, trained on 1,228 subjects, defines a compact neuroimaging embedding space for CN-versus-MCI classification. A residual projection head aligns speech representations to this frozen imaging manifold via a combined geometric loss, adapting speech to the learned biomarker space while preserving imaging encoder fidelity. The frozen MRI classifier, which is never exposed to speech, is applied to aligned embeddings at inference and requires no scanner. Evaluation on ADNI-4 shows aligned speech achieves performance comparable to speech-only baselines (AUC 0.720 vs 0.711) while requiring no imaging at inference, demonstrating that MRI-derived decision boundaries can ground speech representations. Multimodal fusion improves over MRI alone (0.973 vs 0.958). Ablation studies identify dropout regularization and self-supervised pretraining as critical design decisions.

In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption."}
